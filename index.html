	<p><strong>On May 1, 1933</strong>, in the depths of the Great Depression, <em>The Catholic Worker</em> newspaper made its debut with a first issue of twenty-five hundred copies. Dorothy Day and a few others hawked the paper in Union Square for a penny a copy (still the price) to passersby.</p>
	<p><strong>Today</strong> 187 Catholic Worker communities remain committed to nonviolence, voluntary poverty, prayer, and hospitality for the homeless, exiled, hungry, and forsaken. Catholic Workers continue to protest injustice, war, racism, and violence of all forms.</p>
	<p><strong>Explore</strong> the life and writings of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin.<br> <strong>Discover</strong> what Catholic Worker communities worldwide are doing today to fulfill Dorothy and Peter's vision. It is a fascinating story.</p>
