<p><b><center>New Documentary Tells Story of Troublemaker, Grandmother, Pacifist Dorothy Day
Airing on public television stations beginning March 2020
for Women’s History Month</b></center></p>


<p>A new documentary by Martin Doblmeier and Journey Films, REVOLUTION OF THE
HEART: The Dorothy Day Story profiles one of the most extraordinary and courageous women
in American history—one who is being considered for sainthood by the Catholic Church, but who
famously said, “Don’t call me a saint, I don’t want to be dismissed that easily.” Realist and
radical, Day was both a typical grandmother and a self-described anarchist who once made the
FBI’s watch list as a “dangerous American.” Revolution of the Heart is the story of one of the
greatest champions of the poor America has ever known. It will begin airing on public television
stations in March 2020, for Women’s History Month, and available on DVD on December 1,
2019. Special screening events will take place nationwide in January-March, 2020.</p>

<p>As a journalist, Dorothy Day covered workers’ rights and child labor. As an activist, she protested
war and nuclear arms. Attracted to Communism as a young woman, she believed it was a way to
improve people’s lives. She marched in support of women’s suffrage and was jailed and beaten.</p>


<p>After the birth of her daughter, she converted to Catholicism, and found Christianity to be an even
more radical path. “If you take the Lord’s words, you’ll find they are pretty rigorous,” Day says
in archival footage included in the film. “The Sermon on the Mount may be read with great
enjoyment, but when it comes to practicing it, is really is an examination of conscience to see
how far we go.”</p>

<p> Day was co-founder (along with Peter Maurin) of the Catholic Worker Movement that began as a
newspaper to expose rampant injustices during the Great Depression. It soon expanded to become
a network of houses of hospitality to welcome the poor and destitute. Now nearly a century after
they began, the number of Catholic Worker houses continues to grow and the newspaper is still
speaking truth to power.</p>


<p>Over the years, Dorothy Day developed her understanding of how to follow the biblical challenge
to be “peacemakers” by resisting all forms of military intervention. She protested America’s
involvement in World War II and was severely criticized. Arrested multiple times for protesting
America’s nuclear buildup, she also led nationwide resistance against the war in Vietnam.</p>


<p>REVOLUTION OF THE HEART includes rare archival photographs and film footage plus
interviews with Dorothy Day’s granddaughters, writer Kate Hennessey and activist Martha
Hennessey, actor/activist Martin Sheen, public theologian Cornel West, bestselling author Joan
Chittister, Jim Wallis of Sojourners and many others. Excerpts from Day’s autobiography, The
Long Loneliness, are read in the film by Susan Sarandon.</p>
