	<P><I>This essay was written by Jim Forest on the Catholic Worker Movement
	for <B>The Encyclopedia of American Catholic History</B> to be published
	by the Liturgical Press. Jim Forest, once a managing editor of <B>The Catholic
	Worker</B>, is the author of <B>Love is the Measure: a Biography of Dorothy
	Day</B>; and <B>Living With Wisdom: a Biography of Thomas Merton</B>. Both
	are published by Orbis. The illustration is from the &quot;Works of Mercy&quot;

	<P>The Catholic Worker movement was founded in 1933 during the Great Depression
	by Dorothy Day at the urging of Peter Maurin. It is best known for houses
	of hospitality located in run-down sections of many cities, though
	a number of Catholic Worker centers exist in rural areas. Food, clothing,
	shelter and welcome is extended by unpaid volunteers to those in need according
	to the ability of each household. In 1995 there were 134 Catholic Worker
	communities, all but three in the United States. </P>

	<P>&quot;Our rule is the works of mercy,&quot; said Dorothy Day. &quot;It
	is the way of sacrifice, worship, a sense of reverence.&quot; </P>

	<P>The Catholic Worker is also the name of a newspaper
	published by the Catholic Worker community in New York City. From 1933
	until her death in 1980, the editor was Dorothy Day, a journalist who was
	received into the Catholic Church in 1927. Writers for the paper have ranged
	from young volunteers to such notable figures as Thomas Merton, Daniel
	Berrigan and Jacques Maritain. (Many Catholic Worker communities publish
	newsletters or journals chiefly for local distribution.) </P>

	<P>Beyond hospitality, Catholic Worker communities are known for activity
	in support of labor unions, human rights, cooperatives, and the development
	of a nonviolent culture. Those active in the Catholic Worker are often
	pacifists people seeking to live an unarmed, nonviolent life. During periods
	of military consciption, Catholic Workers have been conscientious objectors
	to miliary service. Many of those active in the Catholic Worker movement
	have been jailed for acts of protest against racism, unfair labor practices,
	social injustice and war. </P>

	<P>Catholic Worker communities have refused to apply for federal tax exempt
	status, seeing such official recognition as binding the community to the
	state and limiting the movement's freedom. </P>

	<P>With its stress on voluntary poverty, the Catholic Worker has much in
	common with the early Franciscans, while its accent on community, prayer
	and hospitality has Benedictine overtones. </P>

	<P>&quot;We try to shelter the homeless and give them clothes,&quot; Dorothy
	Day explained, &quot;but there is strong faith at work. We pray. If an
	outsider who comes to visit us doesn't pay attention to our prayings and
	what that means, then he'll miss the whole point.&quot; </P>

	<P>It is unlikely that any religious community was ever less structured
	than the Catholic Worker. Each community is autonomous. There is no board
	of directors, no sponsor, no system of governance, no endowment, no pay
	checks, no pension plans. Since Dorothy Day's death, there has been no
	central leader.
