		<H3>Memories of  Dorothy Day</H3>


		</CENTER>
		<P>
		<HR>

		<P>These recollections are excerpted from <B>Voices from the Catholic
		Worker </B>compiled by Rosalie Riegle Troester, Temple University Press,
		1993. They are reproduced here with permission of Dr. Troester. </P>

		<P>

		<P><B>Ade Bethune </B>(Catholic Worker artist):</P>

		<UL>
		<P>I remember I'd already received a card from the editors saying that
		they were going to use some of my drawings in the paper. Then I saw a notice
		that they could use clothes, so I started gathering old clothes, and one
		day I went down to the Catholic Worker with two bags of clothes.</P>

		<P>I guess I must have looked petrified when I arrived, being so shy
		and not dressed to the hilt, I would say. A big tall woman who looked as
		though she had been carved with an ax, you know, strolled across the room.
		Heh! I was scared of her. But she said very kindly, &quot;Are these your
		things? I'm awfully sorry we don't have any room, but we'll try to put
		you somewhere.&quot;</P>

		<P> She thought I needed a room. Hospitality was being practised on me!
		I said, &quot;Well, I'm the girl who made the pictures.&quot; </P>

		<P> &quot;Oh, you are?&quot;, she said. &quot;Sit right down.&quot; I
		thought Dorothy was very bossy at first. She sat me down on a pile of newspapers
		and sat herself down on another pile. Dorothy was interested in the stories
		of the saints. Real people doing the works of mercy. Not abstract personifications
		but real people. St. Vincent de Paul with the little babies that he gave
		homes to, and St. Martin de Porres taking care of the sick. So every month
		I studied the saints whose feast days were that month and made the pictures
		for the <B>Catholic Worker</B>. </P>
		</UL>

		<P><B>Michael Harrington</B> (writer):</P>

		<UL>
		<P> I arrived at the Worker shortly after Cardinal Spellman had sent
		McIntyre down to read the riot act. What was apparently bugging Spellman
		was that the paper was called the  <B>Catholic  Worker </B> .
		What he was angling for, and didn't get, was for [Dorothy] to drop the
		word &quot;Catholic.&quot; He believed [the name] was an attempt to indicate
		that this was a <B>Catholic</B> position, and he didn't want anybody else
		speaking for the church. This was the famous occasion when McIntyre said
		to her, &quot;What would you do if the cardinal told you to shut down the
		Catholic Worker?&quot; </P>

		<P> She said, &quot;If our dear, sweet cardinal, who is the vicar of
		Christ in New York City, told me to shut down the Catholic Worker, I would
		close it down immediately.&quot; She was dead serious. That's what drove
		me crazy. Dorothy really did go around referring to Spellman as &quot;our
		dear, sweet cardinal&quot; and &quot;the vicar of Christ.&quot; </P>
		</UL>

		<P><B>Jim Forest </B>(editor and author):</P>

		<UL>
		<P> When I think of Dorothy, I think of her first and foremost as a woman
		at prayer. Dorothy was a praying person. If she was at the farm at Tivoli,
		there was a fairly good chance you'd find her in the chapel. Either there
		or at the table drinking coffee with visitors. </P>

		<P> If she was in the chapel, she'd be by herself, even if other people
		were there. Those old knees and those thick, dark stockings and those bulky
		shoes. She'd be there for a long time. I'm sure it wasn't that comfortable
		for her to be on her knees at that point. I can remember -- nosy, snooping-around
		person that I was and still am -- going up to look into her missal or Bible
		or whatever she had left on the pew, looking through and seeing all these
		lists of people she was praying for. In that unmistakable italic-like handwriting. </P>
		</UL>

		<P><B>Judith Molina </B>(theater director and actress):</P>

		<UL>
		<P> Everyone went underground for the civil defense drills, but Dorothy
		said, &quot;I will not go.&quot; A very strong act of will, an act of will
		in which she contradicts what everybody wants her to do, including the
		church. It was a great privilege and a marvel to be secluded with a woman
		like that, to come close to such a soul. </P>

		<P> Dorothy became very quickly a legend in the prison. There was a lot
		of press at the time and a picket line outside. Everybody was aware of
		it, and we were certainly celebrities of a sort inside the prison. Most
		of the guards were Catholic, and they came to her and had their Bibles
		blessed and their rosaries kissed. </P>
		</UL>

		<P><B>Joe Zarrella </B>(Catholic Worker):</P>

		<UL>
		<P> You know, lots of people always quote that business about Dorothy
		saying, &quot;Don't make me a saint; I don't want to be dismissed so easily.&quot;
		And I think -- now this is my personal opinion -- but I think the reason
		she said that was not that she was against canonization or saints. Dorothy
		was forever quoting the saints. She was saying that she didn't want to
		be considered a saint like people in those days considered them. </P>
		</UL>

		<P><B>Tom Cornell </B>(author and editor):</P>

		<UL>
		<P> I don't think Dorothy started with any intention of leading a movement.
		I think her confessors told her it was God's will, and that the authority
		upon her shoulders was devolving naturally. She didn't seek that authority,
		it came to her, and that's why she could exercise it so effectively. </P>
