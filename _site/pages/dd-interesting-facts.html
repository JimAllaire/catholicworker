	<h4>Thirty interesting facts about Dorothy Day's life, many commonly known and others less so:</h4>
		<Ol>
		    <li> Born in 1897, she was raised in a nominally Protestant
		        family and became a Roman Catholic in 1928. </li>
		    <li>One of her early memories was the 1906 San Francisco
		        earthquake and how her mother offered help to quake
		        victims. </li>
		    <li>Her father was a sportswriter who covered racetrack news.</li>
		    <li>She loved reading novels from early childhood on, and her
		        favorite author was Fydor Dostoevsky.</li>
		    <li>She rejected organized religion in college because she
		        didn't see so-called &quot;religious people&quot; helping
		        the poor.</li>
		    <li>In the World War I period she was part of a circle of
		        social radicals and literary types like Eugene O'Neill. </li>
		    <li>She first went to jail with a group of suffragists in
		        1917 who were demonstrating at the White House in favor
		        of giving women voting rights. </li>
		    <li>She had an abortion in a failed relationship when she was
		        22 years old.</li>
		    <li>The birth of her daughter Tamar in 1926, within a
		        common-law marriage, brought her great joy and happiness,
		        and led to her final embrace of the Catholic faith.</li>
		    <li>She was a single parent who supported herself as a
		        free-lance journalist.</li>
		    <li>She met Peter Maurin in 1932, in the midst of the Great
		        Depression.</li>
		    <li>The Catholic Worker newspaper appeared in May 1933 with
		        2,500 copies distributed by hand. Circulation grew to
		        190,000 by 1938, and dropped to 50,000 during World War
		        II, largely because of the paper's pacifist stand.
		        (Today's circulation is over 80,000.) </li>
		    <li>The first House of Hospitality opened in 1933. Today over
		        130 Catholic Worker communities exist in thirty-two
		        states and eight foreign countries.</li>
		    <li>She maintained throughout her life that Peter Maurin, not
		        she, started the Catholic Worker Movement. She called him
		        a modern St. Francis who was responsible for completing
		        her Catholic education.</li>
		    <li>Her written work includes 8 books, 350 plus articles for
		        journals and magazines, and over 1,000 articles for The
		        Catholic Worker newspaper.</li>
		    <li>A heavy smoker for years, she finally gave up the habit
		        &quot;cold turkey&quot; after praying for several years
		        for help in quitting.</li>
		    <li>She went to daily Mass and weekly confession, and
		        regularly went on religious retreats. </li>
		    <li>She read the Bible at a time most Catholics didn't.</li>
		    <li>She travelled long distances by bus. She carried a Bible,
		        a missal, the Divine Office, and a jar of instant coffee
		        on her hundreds of trips.</li>
		    <li>She went to jail four times from 1955 to 1959 for acts of
		        civil disobedience. She with others refused to take
		        shelter during civil defense drills that simulated a
		        nuclear attack on New York City. </li>
		    <li>In 1955 she became a professed secular oblate of the
		        Benedictine Abbey of St. Procopius.</li>
		    <li>She and a group of women fasted for ten days in 1963 in
		        Rome, at Vatican Council II, wanting the bishops to
		        condemn all war. They did condemn nuclear war. </li>
		    <li>She was instrumental in founding Pax Christi USA.</li>
		    <li>She was a prolific letter writer, including many years of
		        correspondence with the monk Thomas Merton. </li>
		    <li>She was a grandmother nine times, with one grandson going
		        to Vietnam with the U.S. military during the war.</li>
		    <li>She was a friend to bishops and cardinals, while being
		        critical of the Church's wealth and support for war and
		        war preparations.</li>
		    <li>She went to India to speak to Mother Teresa's novices and
		        received a cross from Mother Teresa worn by the
		        Missionaries of Charity. </li>
		    <li>Her last jailing was in 1973 at the age of 75 while
		        protesting with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers
		        in California. </li>
		    <li>She loved the beauty of the natural world and would seek
		        out the quiet of a small beach cottage she owned on the
		        shore of Staten Island. </li>
		    <li>Her gravestone has engraved on it a design of loaves and
		        fishes and thewords &quot;Deo Gratias&quot; (&quot;thanks
		        be to God&quot;).</li>
