<p><strong>Catholic Worker Farm gathering -- February 17th--20th -- All are welcome (not just Catholic Worker Farmers!) -- Hosted by St. Isidore Catholic Worker Farm</strong></p>

<p><i>Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day believed the Catholic Worker movement was a light amid the darkness of modern empire. The same holds true today just as it did in 1933. This weekend of fellowship, roundtable discussions & presentations, a barn dance, St. Isidore farm tour, prayer, and great food will be rooted in an awareness that now, as always, we desperately need to simultaneously resist empire and build constructive alternatives, rooted in the land.</i></p>

	<p> Where: <b>First English Lutheran Church</b> (215 W. Pine St.), <b>Platteville, Wisconsin</b> (20 miles north of Dubuque, IA; 80 miles southwest of Madison, WI; 8 miles north of St. Isidore CWF). 	RSVP's are encouraged, especially if you'll need bed space beyond a church floor.</p>
