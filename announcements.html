</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-10">

<p>You can assist the canonization of Dorothy Day, Servant of God, by transcribing her diaries and letters. The transcripts will be sent to the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints.</p>
	
<p>You will be sent a PDF file of a section of Dorothy Dayâ€™s handwritten diaries and letters to type, unedited. 
	
<p>As you finish one packet, if it seems a good fit, you can request another. You will be part of an international team working to support the canonization of Dorothy Day.</p>

<p>If you would like to participate as a transcriber or have further questions, email Jeff Korgen, Coordinator of the Dorothy Day Guild,at <A HREF="mailto:jkorgen@korgen.associates">jkorgen@korgen.associates</A>. Jeff may also be reached at 862-485-5807.</p>	

<p>Blessings and Peace</p>
