<h3>Donate to Dorothy's Cause for Sainthood'</h3>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>


<p>We at the Dorothy Day Guild have been working on the canonization case for Dorothy Day and would like to ask you to consider helping to defray the expenses of canonization (legal and organizational) for this remarkable lay woman.</p>
	 
	<p>Dorothy’s life and work remain an inspiration for us all as she worked with the poor and for changes in the social order towards peace and justice.</p> 
	
	<p>Thanks to the efforts of many volunteers and a small part-time staff, we have the capability to send Dorothy Day’s case for sainthood to the Vatican in the next two years. At this critical juncture, we need your help to get there.</p> 
		
		<p>To help defray unavoidable legal and organizational expenses, we ask for your support. Please join us at this time in lifting up the cause of this remarkable lay woman. Small contributions will make a big difference.</p>

 <p>Many thanks,<br>
The Dorothy Day Guild</p>

<h3>Transcribe Documents</h3>

<p>You can assist the canonization of Dorothy Day, Servant of God, by transcribing her diaries and letters. The transcripts will be sent to the Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints.</p>
	
<p>You will be sent a PDF file of a section of Dorothy Day’s handwritten diaries and letters to type, unedited. 
	
<p>As you finish one packet, if it seems a good fit, you can request another. You will be part of an international team working to support the canonization of Dorothy Day.</p>

<p>If you would like to participate as a transcriber or have further questions, email Jeff Korgen, Coordinator of the Dorothy Day Guild at <A HREF="mailto:jkorgen@korgen.associates">jkorgen@korgen.associates</A>. Jeff may also be reached at 862-485-5807.</p>	

<p>Blessings and Peace</p>
