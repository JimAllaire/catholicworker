			A Story about Dorothy Day as a Young Girl</i></b></h3></center>
						
		<p>Would you like to introduce Dorothy Day to a child? Here’s a new picture book for children based on eight-year-old Dorothy’s experience of a generous community in the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. 
			
		<p>	The story, beautifully illustrated, follows Dorothy, her family, and her friend, living across the Bay from San Francisco. Shaken by an earthquake, they pour out their possessions and energy for those fleeing the fires in San Francisco. Dorothy discovers the joy of coming together as a community to give to those in need. “Why can’t it be this way all the time?” Dorothy wonders. Later in her life, she found inspiration from this experience for the Catholic Worker and her own commitment to the Works of Mercy.

		<p>A short biography of Dorothy follows the story, as well as her own account of the earthquake and the community’s response to it from one of her autobiographies. The back cover and the final page of the book help children link the story with the Corporal Works of Mercy.
