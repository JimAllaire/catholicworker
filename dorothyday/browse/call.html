<h3><i>An Eye For Others, Dorothy Day Journalist: 1916-1917</i></h3>

<p>This book by Tom McDonough opens a new dimension on Dorothy Day whose life has been recorded in numerous biographies and through many prisms.</p>

<p>The 36 articles with her byline in <I>The New York Call</I> guide the reader through New York City, as 18 year old Dorothy visits the homes of the working poor and interviews figures who shaped the 20th Century, such as Leon Trotsky and Margaret Sanger, while America descends into the Great War.</p>

<p>Throughout, we encounter the same Dorothy many came to know later, a woman awake to the human dignity of the less fortunate and vehemently committed to peace.</p> 

 <p>Her months at <I>The Call</I> are October, 1916 through April, 1917. The 100th anniversary is just around the corner.</p>
