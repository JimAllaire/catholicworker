Day often wrote to promote the “arousal of conscience” and the “examination of conscience.” Some pieces explored the nature of conscience, especially as it applied to Catholicism, but Day also wrote to prick readers’ consciences on particular issues. She frequently commented on war, peace, and anti-nuclear themes; on poverty; on race; and on the labor movement. Often touting the primacy of conscience, Day believed that one of the chief objectives of The Catholic Worker was to raise Christians’ consciences on these and other matters.
 
__*December, On Pilgrimage (1948) (DDLW#486)* __ Linking voluntary poverty to self-sacrifice, Day implies that conscience is crucial to fashioning a Christian attitude and lifestyle aimed at alleviating the suffering of the poor and of victims of injustice. At the beginning of Advent, Day reflects on the importance of examination of conscience. As an example of her own use of conscience, she describes her weaknesses and writes that “the remedy is recollection and silence.” She prays, “enlarge Thou my heart, Lord, that Thou mayest enter in.”
 
__*July-August 1948, “Articles on Distributism – 2” (DDLW#160)*__
In making a case for distributism and a “more just distribution of wealth,” Day urges an arousal of conscience in order to raise awareness of the needs of the poor.
 
__*April 1954, “Are the Leaders Insane?” (DDLW#664)*__ In this article, Day denounces hydrogen bomb tests and the production of incendiary bombs and chemical weapons. She writes of the tension between obedience to God and to the state. While she acknowledges God’s command to obey secular authority, when that authority conflicts with God’s law, disobedience to the state may be justified. The conscience is the instrument that reminds us of our duty to God for Day. She argues that “people need to be disturbed,” aroused to opposition to the hydrogen bomb and nerve gas. While she explains that individuals should examine their own consciences when it comes to matters of war and peace, including registering for the draft, she clearly sees the role of The Catholic Worker as being a supplementary conscience for those individuals.
 
__*July-August 1963, “On Pilgrimage – July/August 1963” (DDLW#805)*__
Day’s reflections in this piece focus on civil rights demonstrations in Danville, Virginia. She cites Pope John XXIII’s comments on the rights of conscience in the encyclical Pacem in Terris, arguing that the non-violent struggle for racial justice is foundational to peace. Both the peace and civil rights movements utilize the rights of conscience to do God’s work.
 
__*December 1965, “On Pilgrimage – December 1965” (DDLW#248)*__
The announcement that the second Vatican Council condemned nuclear warfare elicited Day’s approval and sparked her reflections on the nature of conscience. For Day, the decision would lead to a “more enlightened conscience on the part of all men.” She tackles the possibility of following a “wrong or ill-informed conscience” and argues that the consequences of that are mitigated by seeking God’s good as well as by “studying, listening, [and] being ready to hear … opponents’ point[s] of view.” Day expounds on the primacy of conscience and again examines the struggles that come when one’s conscience conflicts with obedience to secular authority.
 
__*May 1970, “On Pilgrimage – Our Spring Appeal” (DDLW#500)*__
Defining the Catholic Worker Movement in this piece, Day notes the significance of following the conscience. She insists that even though it is necessary to “inform one’s conscience,” individuals “must follow one’s conscience still, even if it is an ill-informed one.”
