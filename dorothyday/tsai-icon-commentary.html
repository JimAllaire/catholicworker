		 <P><STRONG>Commentary by Jim Forest</STRONG></P>

		 <P>He [Tsai] hasn't given Dorothy a halo because that's for the Church 
	to do rather than the iconographer, but he has placed her head slightly 
	within a halo-shaped icon of the Holy Trinity. </P>

	<P>This is something I have never seen before but it seems apt. It makes me think of the remark Dorothy made (it may have been to Robert Coles): "If I have accomplished anything in my life, it is because I wasn't embarrassed to talk about God." </P>

	<P>The Holy Trinity is also the primary community, in which all community, all communication, all communion, is rooted. For Dorothy, her life was those three C's.</P> 

	<P>The inspiration behind the original of the Holy Trinity icon, the work of St. Andrei Rublev in the 15th century, was the teaching of Rublev's spiritual father, St. Sergius of Radonezh: "The contemplation of the Holy Trinity destroys all discord."</P>
