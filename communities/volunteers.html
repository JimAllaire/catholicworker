	<h4>Los Angeles Catholic Worker Community - Los Angeles (

			CA)

	    </h4>
		<P>Each summer mid-June through early August, the L.A. Catholic Worker extends an invitation to any adult interested in joining us for a period of six weeks during the summer. It is an opportunity to live and work with a gospel-based community, to discern one's vocation, or just simply to deepen one's social justice experience on a first hand basis. By the way, the weather here in Southern California is great too.

	<p>David House is an intentional community associated with Martin De Porres House of  Hospitality in San Francisco. Martin’s as we affectionately call it was started in December 1971.

		<P>Is God calling you to assist in the gentle birth of a new Catholic Worker House? Is He calling you to grow food and help others form a new agronomic university? If so, please respond by praying for A Simple Life. This new Catholic worker house is 100 years old located in Bells, Texas on 3 acres.This ministry can presently support only one experienced worker resident who is good at begging or can hold a part-time job. The catholic Worker lifestyle is simple, practicing voluntary poverty, being obedient to conscience(God and gospel), and chaste in christian virtue.  The gentle birth of this house requires much labor and multi-tasking abilities of homemaking, gardening and carpentry/building skills.Living space will be evolving with growth. Volunteers are needed at every level and stage of growth.We are begging. Please send monetary gifts. </p>

	<h4>St Francis Catholic Worker - Spotsylvania (

			VA)

	    </h4>
		<P><p>For our ministry of hospitality and love coupled with a retreat ministry for the homeless who are longing for a stronger connection to Christ. We seek a couple and a single person approximately between ages 45 and 65 to join our faith community and work with our retreatants. We look for willing hearts to

	make a long term commitment to engage in all aspects of life here -- from bookkeeping, letter writing, gardening, bed making, retreat direction and faith sharing with our guests, to community prayer and a little laughter.</p>



	<p>We take seriously the command, "Come follow me" and because of that we live a faith fulfilled life.</p>

	<p><b>HISTORICALLY SPEAKING</b></p>

	<p>Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day often went on retreats, themselves. Dorothy wrote of her own retreat experiences and urged others to make retreats. "Food for the soul," she called them. Her writing clearly shows she envisioned Catholic Worker retreat houses --"... It is certainly a dream for the future." We are humbled to be part of the lying out of her dream.</p>





	<p>Inquiries Welcome. Please contact John or Polly Mahoney, or Pumpkin, our cat, at the above address and phone.</p>

	<p>PEACE -- PLEASE PRAY FOR US.</p>
