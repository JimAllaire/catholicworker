		    A little more than seven years ago, the Yankton Catholic Worker community opened the doors of Emmaus House. This ministry provides hospitality for women and children visiting loved ones at the state prisons in Springfield and Yankton, as well as the Human Services Center and the Yankton Federal Prison Camp.

		<p>

		    At the core of our ministry is the love of Christ: It is revealed in the community built amongst our guests. It is manifested by the practice of mutual aid and sharing between our guests. It is a gift for us to practice the Corporal Works of Mercy.

		<p>

			<i>Consider contacting the Emmaus Catholic Worker House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
