		<p>Banyan Abbey is a Miami-based, incarnational ministry in the Catholic Worker tradition. We provide counseling, community organization, mediation, nonviolence training, and interfaith partnerships with local justice non-profits. The South Florida Meditation and Mindfulness Society was born out of Banyan Abbey as a place to offer resources for healing, empowerment, and tools for spiritual evolution. Meditation and Yoga courses are available several times over the course of the year.  Fr. Daniel Medina, OSF, DMin, is the Founder and Steward of Banyan Abbey. We identify as Old Catholic, Franciscan, and Universalist. We are located in the historic Little Havana neighborhood. Please contact us at pastordanielmedina@gmail.com.
