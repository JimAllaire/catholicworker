<p>We are a Catholic Worker community rooted in Jesus’ vision of God’s Reign among us, committed to a shared life of prayer and action in joyful service to people on the margins.</p>

<p>We serve the poor in our midst through a house of hospitality for women and children, a hot shower program for men and women living on the streets, foot care services, a food distribution program, and a safe parking program for those living in their cars.  We are looking to create clean, safe, and sanctioned encampments for those experiencing homelessness in the near future.<p/>  

<p>We oppose all war and war-making, and regularly vigil at Lockheed-Martin, the largest weapons manufacturer in the world.  We also actively oppose ROTC at our local Catholic university campus (Santa Clara University).</p>  

<p>We are currently looking for full-time, live-in Workers as well as part-time volunteers.</p>
