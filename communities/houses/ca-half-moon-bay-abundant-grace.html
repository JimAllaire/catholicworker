	<p>We offer hospitality to families, coordinate a free community breakfast two days a week at the local Lutheran Church, and operate a farm employment program which harvests 20,000 pounds of fresh, organic fruits and vegetables each year for free distribution to the homeless and low-income families at 5 sites in Half Moon Bay. No live in volunteers needed at this time.</p>
