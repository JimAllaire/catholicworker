<p>Corpus Christi House is a daytime drop-in homeless shelter that comes out of the tradition of the Catholic Worker movement and has expanded with participation and support from local churches of various denominations. Our mission is to ease the burden of being homeless by providing a place for people to get out of the weather, take a shower, wash their laundry, pick up mail, use the phone, eat, and be part of a community.</p>
