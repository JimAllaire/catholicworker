	<p>Casa Alma hosts two houses of hospitality for low-income and formerly homeless families and a community house for resident volunteers.  We seek to live simply on a sustainable urban farm.  Our community works for justice and peace, sponsors times of prayer, learning and reflection, and nurtures community.  Contact us for more information or to schedule a visit.

	<p><i>Consider contacting the Charlottesville Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
