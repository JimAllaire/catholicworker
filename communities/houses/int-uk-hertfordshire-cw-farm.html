	    We live with and serve 18 Homeless women and children.  At our two locations, The Farm and Mary House, we offer Psychotherapy, Signposting and Advocacy, Love and Support.  We also grow Organic Vegetables, Berries and Fruit in our kitchen garden.  We do Resistance and have Round Table Discussions.   We also have a Hermitage for quiet Retreats and offer larger retreats too.
