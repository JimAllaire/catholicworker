	<p>A community of young adults living in inner city Brisbane, Australia, who engage with Brisbane's marginalized by providing hospitality, a place to belong and friendships. We actively seek to connect with the wider community through activism; running craft, poetry and documentary nights; morning prayers; Food Not Bombs; involvement with the Waiter's Union; and animal sanctuary (currently housing chickens, cute cats, Guinea pigs and a dog).</p>



		<p><i>Consider contacting the Dorothy Day House of Hospitality to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i></p>
