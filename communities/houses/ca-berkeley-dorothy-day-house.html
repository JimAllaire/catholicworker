	<p>Dorothy Day house is a Catholic Worker community in Berkeley. We are non-denominational, embracing volunteers of many beliefs and faiths.
	
	<p>We believe in providing a consistent, caring presence for the poor and homeless. We are a hospitality group, not an agency. We subscribe to the Catholic Worker philosophy as expressed by Dorothy Day,". . . we are our brother's [and sister's] keeper and. .  .we must have a sense of personal responsibility to take care of our own and our neighbor, at a personal sacrifice."
	
	<p>Currently, we serve a nutritious breakfast seven mornings a week in the men's shelter at the Berkeley Veterans Building, and six mornings a week at University Lutheran Capel, Berkeley.
	
	<p>If you would like to volunteer with us, please call 510-466-5553 and leave a message.

	<p><STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
	    We need volunteers to prepare and serve
	breakfast.  Shifts begin at 5am and 6:30am Monday
	through Saturday.
