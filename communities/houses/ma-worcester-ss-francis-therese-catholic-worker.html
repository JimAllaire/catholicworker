	<p>A small community that provides hospitality to homeless men and women and publishes a periodical. Communal prayer, a weekly peace vigil, tending a squatters garden, and baking at the Bread not Bombs Bakery are some of the works here. The abundance of God is a reality for us. We believe in Peter's vision "to create a society where it is easier to be good."  For more info, please contact theresecw2@gmail.com></p>
