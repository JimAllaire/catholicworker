	<p>Martin’s is a free restaurant that’s been serving San Francisco for 50 years. Currently we offer lunch six days a week. During non-pandemic times, we have a large volunteer base and offer showers and some other services. David House is a 9-bedroom intentional community of full-time volunteers who serve at Martin’s. We have diverse spiritual practices and we share various roles at Martin’s. These include coordinating volunteers, crew-chiefing the kitchen, keeping supplies stocked, maintaining our buildings and vehicles, gardening, and more. Please contact us for more information and to request an application.
