		<p>David House is an intentional community associated with Martin De Porres House of  Hospitality in San Francisco. Martin’s as we affectionately call it was started in December 1971. Since its inception it has been a House of Hospitality in the Catholic Worker tradition. We have grown into a community of people with diverse spiritual practices, but our mission remains the same---“to serve others in the spirit of compassion, understanding and love.” We are an aging community so we are actively seeking young, energetic people, particularly women or couples to come join us in our work at Martins and living in community. Why not come and see if this is where you are being called to serve?</p>
