		<p>Martin de Porres House of Hospitality is a free restaurant, serving breakfast and lunch weekdays, brunch on Sundays, though the main meal is a large portion of compassion, understanding and love. Community of people reflecting diverse spiritual practices, Martin's is rooted in the Catholic Worker Movement, following the philosophy of "gentle personalism", in which all persons have dignity; eating is a right, not a privilege; feeding the hungry is a matter of justice, not charity. David House is an intentional community serving Martin's.
