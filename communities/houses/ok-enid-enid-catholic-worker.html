		<p>We are Christians dedicated to living simply, feeding the hungry, staying close to the land, and serving Jesus Christ in everyone we meet. We deliver weekly meals to food insecure people in Broken Arrow in our Big Pink Food Trailer. Some of our members are working toward establishing a communal farm in Northeast Oklahoma.</p>


		<p><i>Consider contacting the Enid Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i></p>
