	<P>Our community houses 30-40 homeless people nightly. About 10 of our 
	guests are long term. We do hospice with guests from the streets and the 
	prisons. We are a consistent life community working in justice issues around life 
	issues. Currently working to close the SOA and end sanctions in Iraq. 
	Disability rights and opposition to assisted suicide with Not Dead Yet. (Lana and 
	Steve's daughter Heather DeMien is a national Disability Rights leader.) The core 
	community has been together 16 years.</FONT></P>
