<p>Day House was founded in 1978. For over forty years, the 10-bedroom house has served as a transitional home for folks (mostly women) experiencing housing instability. We also provide general services like showers, laundry, mail, meeting space for activist organizations, and a weekly community mass and dinner. Day House is closely connected with Manna Meal soup kitchen, which serves out St. Peter's Episcopal Church just a few blocks away. We welcome visitors and potential volunteers!

		<p>Currently, the house is in transition. Our current live-in community is Catherine Zettner and Kateri Boucher, who were both raised in and around the Catholic Worker movement (Cat here in Detroit, and Kateri in Rochester, NY). We are focusing on fixing up the house, deepening community connections, and offering small-scale transitional hospitality and solidarity housing. We’re excited and grateful to carry on this tradition.
