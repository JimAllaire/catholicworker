		<p>Lydia’s House is a Catholic Worker community which began hosting families in April 2014. The mission of Lydia’s House is to provide housing and support for women and their children in times of crisis, including refugees and families experiencing homelessness. The house is grounded in the Catholic Worker commitments to personalism, solidarity, faith and community, practiced alongside gospel-prescribed works of mercy.</p>

		<p><strong>Volunteers needed:</strong><br>
		Lydia's House is currently seeking Maternal and Family Advocates to live in a communal setting and work alongside women and young children in crisis. We are seeking single women or couples who would serve for one year, with the possibility of extending. Applicants should be in good health, both mental and physical, and should demonstrate a willingness to engage in basic case management, political advocacy, house management, and accompanying families through challenging experiences. Advocates must be people of faith who desire to embrace life in a Christian community and commit to regular prayer and service. Lydia’s House offers an opportunity for folks to take a year to embrace simplicity. We provide a stipend to live-in volunteers, room and board, access to quality doula certification, as well as funding for self care and continuing education.
