		<p>Lydia’s House is a Catholic Worker community which began hosting families in April 2014. The mission of Lydia’s House is to provide housing and support for women and their children in times of crisis, including refugees and families experiencing homelessness. The house is grounded in the Catholic Worker commitments to personalism, solidarity, faith and community, practiced alongside gospel-prescribed works of mercy.</p>

		<p><strong>Volunteers needed:</strong><br>
		Lydia's House is currently seeking Associate Volunteers to live in a communal setting and work alongside our women and children in crisis.   We are in need of year-long Associates who would serve from September 2016 - August 2017. We ask that all applicants for the Associates Program be at least 25 years of age. Applicants should be in good health, both mental and physical, and should demonstrate a willingness to be challenged and grow. Associates must be people of faith who desire to embrace life in a Christian community and commit to regular prayer and service. Applicants should be interested in living alongside the poor and living simply.  For more information, visit our website at www.stlydiashouse.org or contact   
		us at info@stlydiashouse.org.
