    <p>Publication: <i>Brot und Rosen</i><br>

	<p>"Bread and Roses" was founded in 1994 by german volunteers returning from experience in US-Communities such as the CW, the Open Door Community (Atlanta, Jubilee Partners (Comer, GA), and CCNV (Washington, DC). The 6-member base community started a 12-room house of hospitality in 1996. Guests are mostly refugees. Members live in community of income, have a daily common prayer and try to educate on justice and refugee issues.
