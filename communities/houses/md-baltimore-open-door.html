	<p>Dorothy Day advised “stay small, " and as a remnant of the beloved Open Door Community of Atlanta (1981 to 2016), we are testimony to the wisdom of our Catholic Worker Elders.  After facing the wrenching death of our community, the founding partners--Murphy Davis and Ed Loring--along with David Payne. moved to Baltimore.  We have grown by one: Simon Ibo lives and works with us and is resident in our Christ Room, so we are 3/4 white which is not the same as 3/5s. We have been, are, and will be committed and shaped by the Black Freedom Movement (Today Black Lives Matter). Our Jesus is Black.  We do prisoner support and perform The Welcome Table twice a week,although the pandemic curtailed the latter. Martin King is also a shaping presence in our lives as is the support we have received from the Los Angeles Catholic Worker and its sister communities.  We, too, want to tear down this filthy rotten system. We are political and vote and work for just policies.  We are pro-women and work to maintain Roe Vs Wade.  Like all, we are simul Justus et peccator and we know you can’t get to heaven unless you raise a lot of hell.  Contact us to order my dear wife's book, Surely Goodness and Mercy: A Journey into Illness and Solidarity-- Ed Loring</p>
