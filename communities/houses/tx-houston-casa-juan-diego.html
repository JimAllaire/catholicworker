	<p><b>Volunteer Opportunity: </b>Casa Juan Diego, the Houston Catholic Worker,has an opportunity for live-in Catholic Workers to work with immigrants and refugees. Casa Juan Diego provides hospitality (shelter) in several buildings in Houston, including a main center for women and children; shelter for immigrant men, two houses for sick and wounded men, and social service centers. Assistance is given to 150 paralyzed or very ill immigrants or refugees in the community who can receive no government help. Free medical care is provided to poor immigrants and refugees of the community in our clinic and food is provided to 500 individuals or families each week.</p>
	
	<p>The mission statement of Casa Juan Diego is Matthew 25 in the Bible, where the Lord tells us that on Judgment Day we will be judged on how we have responded to Him in the disguise of the poor. </p>

	<p>Functional Spanish is essential.</p>
