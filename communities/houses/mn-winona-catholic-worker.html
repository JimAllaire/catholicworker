	    We are two houses of hospitality in the Catholic Worker tradition offering drop-in hospitality and evening meal for anyone in need, Monday thru Friday at the Dan Corcoran House (802 W Broadway). We also offer overnight hospitality for single men at Bethany House (832 W Broadway).

	We publish a newsletter, hold monthly roundtable discussions on topics of current interest, and occasionally organize community events of prayer and protest.

	All are welcome to join us for weekly Eucharistic liturgy on Mondays at 5:00pm, followed by community supper.

		<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
	    We are seeking live-in community members to share in intentional community and the works of mercy. If you are a light-hearted, compassionate, spiritually grounded person you might enjoy sharing your life with the poor in our small, family style houses of hospitality. Winona is a small city in southeastern Minnesota, located between the Mississippi River and its bluffs. The scenic beauty of the area helps to strengthen our awareness of rural life and farming issues, while maintaining a global justice perspective. If you are interested, please contact us by phone at 507.454.8094, or email at winonacatholicworker@gmail.com, or by our PO Box 102, Winona, MN 55987.
