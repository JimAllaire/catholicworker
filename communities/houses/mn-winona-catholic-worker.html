		<p>We are a house of hospitality in the Catholic Worker tradition.  We are currently open for hospitality at Bethany House (832 W Broadway) Monday through Friday from 4-7 P.M. with a hot meal at 6 P.M. During our open hours we welcome anyone to join us for a cup of coffee, conversation and a warm, safe place to rest.  We also offer showers, laundry, and use of our phone. We publish a periodic newsletter, hold roundtable discussions on topics of current interest, and occasionally organize community events of prayer and protest. All are welcome to join us for a weekly prayer gathering on Mondays at 5:00pm, followed by community supper.

		<p><STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
	    We run our house with a large collection of local volunteers who do the works of mercy in a variety of ways. We encourage people to participate in the life of the community in a way that challenges and feeds them.  Winona is a small city in southeastern Minnesota, located between the Mississippi River and its bluffs. The scenic beauty of the area helps to strengthen our awareness of rural life, farming and the reality of climate crisis, while our work of hospitality grounds us in the daily needs of the most vulnerable. If you are interested, please contact us by phone at 507.454.8094, or email at winonacatholicworker@gmail.com, or by our PO Box 102, Winona, MN 55987.
