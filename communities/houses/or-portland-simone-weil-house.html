	<p>We are a domestic community at the intersection of a Catholic Worker house of hospitality to those in housing need, and a public household serving as node for neighborhood-based social, economic, and intellectual life. 
</p>
	<p><i>Consider contacting the Enid Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i></p>
