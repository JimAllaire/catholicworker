	<p>We are a non-profit bed and breakfast serving those visiting their loved ones at the Alderson Federal Prison Camp. Currently, our community is full, but we are always open to visitors and/or short term volunteers.

	<p><i>Consider contacting the Alderson Hospitality House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
