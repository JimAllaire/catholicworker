	<p>My family is opening a Catholic Worker Farm in Silverton, Oregon. Joy Farm will open to guests on May 1st and have the capacity to house six unhoused women and two families with children. We hope to build up to a small farm operation over the next two years. Our focus will be on hospitality and community resilience through food and handcraft.</p>
