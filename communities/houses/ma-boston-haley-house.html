	<p>	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
	    We are looking for 3-6 summer interns to live in our intentional community while working in Boston's oldest soup kitchen. Interns will be expected to work 2-3 shifts in the soup kitchen, where they will cook and share a meal with guests and fellow volunteers. Interns will also be given a secondary placement. Examples of secondary placements include our urban garden project, the McKinley Garden, our cooking class series, Take Back the Kitchen, and our pay-what-you-can meal series, Community Tables. For more information and application materials, visit our website: http://haleyhouse.org/internships.shtml
	<p>Haley House is also seeking long-term live-in community members. This is a full-time commitment that includes living simply and communally with 4-9 other members while contributing primarily to the day-to-day running of the Soup Kitchen. Members spend their days engaging with guests and challenging attitudes that perpetuate suffering. For more information, visit our website: http://haleyhouse.org/livein_community_join.
