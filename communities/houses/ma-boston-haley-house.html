	We always welcome volunteers to be a part of our work. Visit haleyhouse.org/volunteer for more information about current opportunities.

	
	
	<p>Haley House welcomes applications to be part of the live-in community on a rolling basis. This is a full-time commitment that includes living simply and communally (room and board included) with 4-9 other members while managing the day-to-day operations of the Soup Kitchen, Food Pantry and Elder Meal, and a 2-year commitment is ideal. Members spend their days engaging with guests and challenging attitudes that perpetuate suffering. For more information, visit: haleyhouse.org/what-we-do/community/
		
<p>Haley House welcomes interns each summer to live in the intentional community while working in Boston's oldest soup kitchen. Interns normally work 2-3 shifts in the soup kitchen, where they cook and share meals with guests and fellow volunteers. Interns usually also have a secondary placement somewhere else in the organization (ie. at our urban farm, in our cooking program, the Bakery Cafe, etc.). Applications are due in March. For more information and exact dates, visit: haleyhouse.org/what-we-do/community/internships/
