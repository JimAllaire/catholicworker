		<p>Nazareth House (Bahay Nazareth) is an ecumenical house of hospitality rooted in the spirit of the Catholic Worker Movement  founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933. We seek to embody the Gospel ideals of prayer, voluntary poverty and simplicity of life, and corporal and spiritual works of mercy, which include solidarity with the poor and the oppressed, non-violent peace and justice, radical hospitality, and life in community. Located in Manila, Philippines, our main apostolic ministry is to provide a home to persons living with HIV or AIDS who do not have adequate financial means for housing, and are unable to secure assistance from family or friends. We are LGBTQ friendly.</p>
