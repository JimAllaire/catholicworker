<p>Dandelion House is a house of hospitality, urban farm, and spiritual community that opened in 2022 to serve those in need in the Portland-metro area.  We are named for the beautiful flower that many think of as a weed, but is actually wonderful food and medicine.</p>


<p><strong>Volunteers needed:</strong><br>
We are looking for people interested in joining a small, live-in Catholic Worker community.  Prior community living experience, grounding in spiritual practice, and commitment to a nonviolent revolution are helpful.</p>
