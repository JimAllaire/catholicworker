		    The St. Francis/St. Joseph CW is a house of hospitality for 15 homeless men, open since 1984. We also provide a soup kitchen 3 days/week and host an AA meeting 2 times/week. We are interested in receiving newslettes and sending our newsletter to people interested in our house. We can house a guest who is interested in the Catholic Worker Movement or one who would like to visit from another Catholic Worker House.
