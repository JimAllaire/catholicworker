		<p>The St. Francis/St. Joseph CW is a house of hospitality for 15 homeless men, open since 1984. We also provide a soup kitchen 3 days/week and host an AA meeting 2 times/week. We are interested in receiving newslettes and sending our newsletter to people interested in our house. We can house a guest who is interested in the Catholic Worker Movement or one who would like to visit from another Catholic Worker House.

		<p><i>Consider contacting the St Francis / St Joseph Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
