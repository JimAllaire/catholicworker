		<p>The St. Francis â€“ St. Joseph Catholic Worker House is a home for homeless men providing 16 beds. Many of our guests are reentering society after prison, and most have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The house is open to men who have made a personal commitment to make over their life and move on to independent living.


		<p><i>Consider contacting the St Francis / St Joseph Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
