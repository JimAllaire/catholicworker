    <p>Publication: <i>TROUBADOUR </i> and the St. Francis House eblast<br>
	    <p>St. Francis House is a place of prayer, a house of hospitality, and a center for peace and justice ministry. Located in downtown New London, we are an ecumenical Christian community, rooted in Franciscan and Catholic Worker spirit, seeking conversion of life for ourselves through friendship with and service to God and our neighbors. We pray together daily and ground our life in weekly African Method of Bible Study.
<p>Since we began our life here in 1999 we have sought to get to know and support our neighbors in developing their work in the community.  These relationships have led to foundational and ongoing work on homelessness, urban gardening and agriculture, regional land trust development, affordable housing, urban education reform, youth empowerment and peace witness.  Our Hermitage and Conference Room are available for individual and group retreats or sabbaticals. 
<p>In both fall and spring, we sponsor bi-weekly Clarification of Thought series: Evening Prayer and supper followed by discussion on the topic of the day.  We utilize Zoom when needed. 
<p>Check out our website and contact us to find out more about resident, sabbatical and volunteer  opportunities and our community life.  The website includes back issues of the Troubadour newsletter which is a good source of information on how we started and developed.  We now use eblast to publicize special events and regular House activities and resource sharing.

	<p><i>Consider contacting the St Francis House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
