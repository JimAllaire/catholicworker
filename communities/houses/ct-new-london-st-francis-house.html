	    St. Francis House is a place of prayer, a house of hospitality, and a center for peace and justice ministry in New London, Connecticut.  We are an intentional Christian community, rooted in Franciscan and Catholic Worker spirit, seeking conversion of life for ourselves through friendship with and service to God and our neighbors.  We pray together daily, ground our life in Bible study, and do the work we believe God is calling us to in our inner city neighborhood.<p>

	At present our ministry includes work with homeless men and women in the Homeless Hospitality Center we helped to establish and continue to serve; urban education reform through our bilingual parents group; urban gardening; and resistance to war and Empire with fellow Catholic Workers and others. <p>

	Each summer we hold a weeklong residential "Radical Discipleship" course involving in debth Bible study, experience of other communities, and reflection on our discipleship in the 21st century US.  We also have a Hermitage available for people seeking do make retreats or sabbath time.
