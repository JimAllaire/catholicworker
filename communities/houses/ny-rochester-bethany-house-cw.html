<p>Bethany House is a Catholic Worker House of Hospitality which has offered shelter to women and their children in need of hospitality since 1977. Women come for a variety of reasons; some have been victims of domestic violence, some have been evicted from their homes, some are trying to recover from alcohol and/or drug addiction, some are being released from incarceration, and some have been hospitalized for illness of mind and/or body.

<p>Bethany House supports women in need in the Rochester area, as they get back on their feet! Our motto is, ”We will love you, until you can love yourself”. Our primary ministry is shelter and hospitality for women and their children up to 45 days. In addition, we offer a food pantry, as well as diapers and infant formula to our neighbors.
