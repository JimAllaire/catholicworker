		<p>The Oakland Catholic Worker serves members of the Latin American immigrant and refugee community as they establish themselves in our East Oakland neighborhood.  We provide temporary housing and accompaniment, hot meals, groceries, English classes, cultural events, and other services to people in need. In solidarity with those we serve, we struggle to change the unjust structures of our society through social activism.

		<p><STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
		    	We are accepting applications for full-time live-in staff members at our house of hospitality for Latin American immigrants. Staff members receive room and board and a stipend, commit for at least a year, should speak Spanish, and will primarily focus on accompaniment/case management for our guests and coordinating our English as a second language classes. Secondary responsibilities could include working with our food programs; managing our newsletter, website, and social media; outreach and advocacy; fundraising; bookkeeping, data-entry, and finances; volunteer coordination; and maintenance of the house, yard, and garden. Begin winter/summer 2018.</p>
				<p>We also seek part-time volunteers to help serve food, pass out groceries, teach English, tutor our guests, improve/maintain the house and yard, and complete other tasks.
