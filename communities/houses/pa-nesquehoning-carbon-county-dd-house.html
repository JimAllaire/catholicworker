		<p>The Carbon County Catholic Worker has obtained a new, very large building that was a Catholic School with a rectory/house attached. We are seeking live-in help, help purchasing houses that surround the old school, help turning the school into a community and retreat center, and monetary donations to keep the lights on and increase our outreach efforts.</p>
		<p>Donations can be sent to:<br>
		14 Holland Street<br>
		Nesquehoning, PA 18240<br>
		 

		<p><strong>Volunteers</strong><br>
