		<p>The Dorothy Day House of Carbon County is a small community run by a couple with two children ages 2 and 5. Our focus is meeting peoples needs who live in poverty. We redistribute food and clothing, take in children when necessary to keep them out of the foster care system, and are starting a newsletter</p>
		<p>We are currently in need of monetary donations, as we are in crisis with one half of the couple going into surgery September 2019.  </p> 

		<p><strong>Volunteers</strong><br>
		We are also in need of a live-in volunteer to help with driving.</p>
		
		<p><i>Consider contacting Carbon County Dorothy Day House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i></p>
