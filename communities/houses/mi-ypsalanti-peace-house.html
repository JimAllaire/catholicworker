		<p>Peace House, Ypsi is a house of hospitality in the tradition of the catholic worker movement. We are a private residence that opens our home to be in solidarity and community with those experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity. We have open hours (drop in hours) when folks can drop by to do laundry, shower and make themselves a bite to eat. On Sunday we cook brunch which is served "family style".  We have a "free store" with donated clothing,and toiletries as well as some household items for when folks secure housing.  Peace House, Ypsi has a "front porch pantry" that is open 24-7, geared toward those camping or living out of hotels. </p>
