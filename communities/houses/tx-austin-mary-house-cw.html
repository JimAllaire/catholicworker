	    Mary House Catholic Worker of Austin (Texas), founded in 1991, is a small Catholic Worker community which offers housing to homeless adults with critical and/or terminal illnesses who have no other resources. Ours is the ONLY free housing available to these people. We live and work in the tradition of the Catholic Worker movement, referring to the Gospel of Jesus, the social teaching of the Catholic community of faith, and the writings and experience of our founders, Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin.
