		    Little Flower is a small CW homestead in rural VA, about a 1/2 hour east of Charlottesville. We grow food, and practice community, hospitality and resistance. We spend our days working--mostly manual labor, sometimes for pay; protesting war, building giant puppets, weeding the garden and responding to the needs of the moment. We welcome visitors, whether in need of shelter or looking to experiment with an alternative lifestyle of precarity, community and taking personal responsibility for addressing systemic violence. Send us an e-mail and we'll eventually check it on our slow dial-up, or call or write.
