		<p>We are a faith­-based farming community in the Catholic Worker tradition of a land and craft—based economy, the works of mercy and Restoration Agriculture. Believing in the sacredness of the land, our agricultural practices strive to be ecologically sustainable, economically sound, and socially just. Our animals are humanely­ raised and our farming is perennial—based. As a community farm, we welcome visitors to cooperatively learn practical skills and enjoy real food. We bring a spirit of joy to our work and share our excitement for local food and culture with our community.</p>
