	<p>CAIN is a neighborhood ministry that transforms lives and inspires hope by providing nutritious food, crisis assistance, resources, and compassion in a way that respects human dignity and builds a more vibrant community.</p>

	<p>CAIN was gifted with Grace Place, a beautiful home located in College Hill that has offered shelter to women and children in the Catholic Worker tradition for nearly two decades</p>

	<p>The Interfaith Hospitality Network (IHN) of Greater Cincinnati provides homeless families emergency  shelter and hospitality through interfaith communities, and works with families to find and  retain stable housing.</p>

	<p>In the summer of 2016, CAIN and IHN  began a collaborative effort in the use of Grace Place to provide shelter to women and children in transition from homelessness. In 2016, the partnership at Grace Place has touched the lives of our guest residents (41 moms and 93 children) and volunteers (312 volunteers from 25 Hosting Congregations).</p>


	<p><STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
	 CAIN and IHNGC are seeking volunteer groups from congregations, schools, youth groups, service clubs, businesses and other organizations looking for opportunities to serve women and children experiencing homelessness. Volunteer groups will be providing meals (dinners, breakfasts, and lunches to pack), occasional evening activities, and an overnight volunteer, if possible.</p>

	<p>This is a wonderful opportunity to work with others in the faith community offering hospitality to women and children in need. It can truly be a summer of grace for all involved.</p>

	<p>Contact Hume Jamison at IHNGC at hume@ihncincinnati.org, or 513-471-1100, ext. 110, or contact MiMi Chamberlin at director@cainministry.org or 513-591-2246, ext. 3 to learn more or to help.</p>
