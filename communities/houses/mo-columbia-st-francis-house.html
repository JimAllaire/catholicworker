	<p>We do hospitality for homeless men and women including showers, breakfast and supper and laundry facilities and overnight beds for up to 8 guests. We no longer do hospice care and Lana Jacobs is no longer part of our community. Our women's house Z. Lois Bryant House is currently  empty until we get more live-in community members. We also coordinate volunteers for Loaves and Fishes Soup Kitchen. - Steve Jacobs
