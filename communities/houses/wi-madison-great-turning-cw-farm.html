		<p>we are The Great Turning Catholic Worker Farm, and include myself (Justin) and Andrea Novotney, and our two young boys, Joe (3) and Matt (1). We established The Great Turning CWF on June 2019 primarily as a community of resistance - engaging in that work of direct action & resistance alongside family life, community life, and gardening & farming.</p>
