		<p>Viva  House opened in 1968 and for the past half a century our community has provided  hospitality (soup kitchen, food pantry ) for our neighbors, and we do  our best to resist the injustices of capitalism, militarism, racism, and sexism. Willa Bickham and Brendan Walsh have published a book, The Long Loneliness In Baltimore: Stories Along the Way, in an attempt to explain our work through essays and art. (Apprentice House Press, Loyola University Maryland, 2019).  Copies are also available from Viva House.
