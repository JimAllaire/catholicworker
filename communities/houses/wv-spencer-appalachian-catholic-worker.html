	<p>We are a seamless garment Catholic Worker farm that strives to live the Gospel in light of Catholic social teaching.  Our E.C.O. Center offers Education, Contemplation and Outreach in the context of Creation. By promoting social and environmental justice, hosting retreatants and service groups, and practicing the works of mercy, we address both the root causes and effects of poverty in the hills and hollers of Appalachia.  Our community is a diaspora of educators, activists, students and volunteers, while one lives here full-time. Cottage industries include free range eggs, books, and Catholic Worker icons, note cards and bookmarks.  We are not tax exempt.

	<p><i>Consider contacting the Appalachian Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
