	    CWH-San Antonio is a Day Center of Hospitality. Three meals (approximately 400 per day) are provided to our guests each weekday, as well as, other amenities such as clothing, travel-sized hygiene supplies, books, movies, and laundry, phone, email and postal services.  Volunteers and former guests who desire to help with our ministry of "hospitality of the heart" live in community in a third house and share in the daily soup kitchen and other tasks.
