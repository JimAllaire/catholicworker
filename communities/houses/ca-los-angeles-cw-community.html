	    The L.A. Catholic Worker is a lay Catholic community of men and women which operates a free soup kitchen, hospitality house for the homeless, AIDS ministry, hospice for the dying, newspaper, and regularly offers prophetic witness in opposition to war-making and injustice. Each summer mid-June through early August, the L.A. Catholic Worker extends an invitation to any adult interested in joining us for a period of six weeks during the summer. It is an opportunity to live and work with a gospel-based community, to discern one's vocation, or just simply to deepen one's social justice experience on a first hand basis. By the way, the weather here in Southern California is great too.
