	    We serve the working poor of Los Angeles and are building a movement for a living wage. We distribute food to the homes of immigrant workers. We support whistle-blowers who stand up for their rights at their jobs. We offer our house of hospitality to those in need. And we do resistance work: organizing students, workers and community to fight for a living wage. We need volunteers who want to live communally, grow spiritually, and join the movement.
