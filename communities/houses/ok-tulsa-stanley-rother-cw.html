		<p>Stanley Rother Catholic Worker (SRCW) has provided emergency assistance for people in Tulsa and the surrounding area since 2013. We seek to focus on individual needs through direct encounter. We are dedicated to serving Jesus Christ in everyone we meet.</p>
		
		<p>We are a non-profit, non-hierarchical group that emphasizes egalitarian values and communal decisions. Both those providing and receiving support are considered members of SRCW.</p>		
		<p>SRCW manages Kraston House, which opened in January 2018. Kraston House is a house of hospitality where those who are in transition or difficult circumstances can find a place to live and receive support for up to six months. Guests live in the house without financial obligation but take responsibility for maintaining a clean and welcoming living environment. They are also required to develop and implement a plan for becoming self-sufficient. Catholic Workers regularly check in with guests and the house. Kraston House can accommodate up to six guests, who are recommended to SRCW by a minister who has worked with the homeless in Tulsa for over a decade.</p>
		
		<p>Note: Please call before coming to the house.</p>
