	<p>A traditional Catholic Worker community practicing hospitality, common prayer, the works of mercy, and Catholic Social Teaching. Join us for daily Vespers, Friday roundtable discussions, and Sunday socials. Our ministry currently seeks to provide subsidized housing, plentiful food, spiritual nourishment, and joyful community to our guests and visitors. In the long-term, we are committed to parish renewal, intentional community in our neighborhood, social justice and ecological conversion in our city, and founding an associated farming community in the countryside. </p>
