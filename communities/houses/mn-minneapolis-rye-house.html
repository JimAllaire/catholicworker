		<p>We are an intentional community and house of hospitality in South Minneapolis.&#160; We are inspired by peace movements including the Civil Rights Movement, the Catholic Worker Movement, and the Food Justice Movement.&#160; Most of all, we are motivated by good conversations shared over meals and humble, challenging love. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Our Projects:</strong> </p>
		
		<p>We have been cooking and serving meals at a street corner near our house on Thursday and Friday nights.&#160; Our meals accompany a weekly event known as the Amen Corner put on by the Ventura Village Neighborhood Association (our neighborhood).&#160; The Amen Corner is a two hour-long open mic meant to act as a space to foster positive change in our community. </p>

		<p>We invest a lot of time and thought into gardening, home-based food production, and ethical food purchasing.&#160; We raise chickens, do compost and vermiculture,&#160; extend the harvest through canning, freezing, and preserving, and we try to either get food for free, grow it ourselves, or buy it local and organic. </p>

		<p>We work with friends to plan roundtable discussions about topics that we believe to be positive and life-giving.&#160; We have so far had roundtables on heterosexual privilege/transgender identities, racism within our American school system, and Catholic Womanpriests. </p>

		<p>We also host people who are either homeless, refugees, or in a period of transition. </p>

		<p>The four core community members also practice a common purse.&#160; This means that we share the money we earn at jobs outside the house and pay for our needs collectively.</p>
