	<p>The Community of the Franciscan Way (CFW) is a Catholic Worker farm and Mission of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina. We are a community where prayer, work, and friendship with the poor create a society where it is easier for people to be good. Nine permanent residents currently live in on the farm, and our Christ Room is available nightly for temporary guests. On our farm, we raise our own beef, dairy, eggs, chicken, and turkey. All of animals are pasture raised and fed a non-GMO ration that is grown and milled locally. The Daily Office of Morning and Evening Prayer frames each week day. Funds and donations are directly used for the performance of the corporeal and spiritual works of mercy, and no one in the House draws any compensation from contributions.
