	Manna House is a place of hospitality for poor and homeless persons in Memphis, TN.  We stand in the Catholic Worker tradition of hospitality, advocacy, and work for peace and justice.  We are a non-residential community of volunteers who offer hospitality three mornings a week, commit to a simple life, and engage in activism with other organizations for justice and peace.  We gather regularly for reflection and worship together.



	<p>

		<i>Consider contacting the Manna House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
