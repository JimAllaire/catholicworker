		<p>Poverello House of Hospitality, a Catholic Worker Community, is  inspired by the  Franciscan Charisma and  Benedictine Hospitality. We  provide food, clothing, shelter and spiritually-centered care to our  resident guests and an outreach to our needy  brothers and sisters  of the community.</p>
		<p>We share a firm belief in the God-given dignity of every human person; and we are committed to nonviolence, voluntary poverty, and the Works of Mercy as a way of life.
