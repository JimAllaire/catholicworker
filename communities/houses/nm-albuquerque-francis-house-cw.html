		<p>Francis House Catholic Worker was incorporated in April of 2019 and 
embraces a two-pronged mission to serve both the unhoused in our 
neighborhood and border refugees at our southern doo</p>
<p>From our rented facility of 5 rooms, we distribute meals to our hungry 
neighbors in the International District of Albuquerque, NM six days a week 
from 8am to 3pm (closed Wednesdays). At tables we set up in sun or shade 
depending on the season, those experiencing homelessness can enjoy a 
breakfast of home-made bean burritos and coffee/juice and water. For lunch 
we ladle out hot home-made soups (“holy posole” on Sundays), fruit, and a 
variety of sandwiches and cookies, all made by our generous volunteers. Our
guests enjoy access to hygiene kits and warm blankets, a bathroom, and our 
outdoor water tank. We welcome local outreach groups to use our space for 
education and recovery meetings.</p>
<p>For our second ministry we send three teams to the southern border in El 
Paso, Texas. On three Wednesdays a month a team carries essential donated 
supplies for displaced asylum seekers who arrive at Annunciation House 
shelters for respite, communication with US sponsors, and transportation to 
their new homes.</p>
