		<p>Francis House Catholic Worker formed in March of 2019.
		We do not own property and we rent from a local church 5 rooms where
		we serve food every Sunday (Holy Posole) and 200 burritos.  We also go
		out into the streets to share the burritos and have since October of
		2017.  We have a meditation room and we teach centering
		prayer/meditation in English and Spanish.  We have a women's support
		group meeting weekly as well as a mixed spirituality group going on
		now for 3 years.  We do bimonthly retreats in local retreat houses.
		Our other main ministry is with the Asylum Seekers in El Paso.  We
		gather donations of food, clothes and toiletries and take them to
		Annunciation House every Friday.</p>
