   	<p>	St. Francis Farm Community’s mission is to live a sustainable life based on the Gospels and on Catholic Worker principles as an alternative to the consumer culture.  The community provides practical assistance, prayerful presence and a place for reflection to help others simplify their lives. For more information see our website, www.stfrancisfarm.org</p>

	<p>We’re all volunteers; we live together intentionally, sharing work, meals, and time for silent prayer and reflection. The current core community is a Quaker family. We welcome people of all faiths, and people who have none.</p>

	<p>We raise food for ourselves, volunteers, and a local soup kitchen. We’re working toward a sustainable integrated farm that minimizes wastes and purchased inputs. We have herb and vegetable gardens, goats, pigs, rabbits and chickens, and we harvest firewood and lumber from our woods.</p>
	
	<p><b>Volunteers needed:</b><br>
		
	</p>
	<p>We seek new community members to join us in living an alternative to the consumer culture, growing food to share, practicing sustainable forestry, and offering prayerful presence and outreach to neighbors and guests. For more information please see <a href="http://www.stfrancisfarm.org" target="_blank">St. Francis Farm New Members</a> </p>
	
	<p>We also seek growing-season volunteers to help with farm and woods work between April and October. If you want to learn about sustainable agriculture and build practical skills, or just to work with your hands and enjoy nature, consider volunteering with us.</p>

	<p>We expect volunteers to be respectful of people with different backgrounds, ideologies, abilities and disabilities; to work through conflicts; to refrain from proselytizing; and to abstain from alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity outside marriage while they are with us.</p>

	<p>Day visitors/volunteers are welcome; please call ahead and let us know you’re coming. Overnight volunteers begin with a visit between Monday and Saturday. There is no minimum time commitment, and the initial time can be extended by mutual agreement. Please read our ,<a href="http://www.stfrancisfarm.org/volunteers" target="_blank">Volunteers page</a>.
