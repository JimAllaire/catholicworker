   	<p>	St. Francis Farm Community’s mission is to live a sustainable life based on the Gospels and on Catholic Worker principles as an alternative to the consumer culture.  The community provides practical assistance, prayerful presence and a place for reflection to help others simplify their lives. For more information see our website, www.stfrancisfarm.org</p>

	<p>We’re all volunteers; we live together intentionally, sharing work, meals, and time for silent prayer and reflection. The current core community is a Quaker family. We welcome people of all faiths, and people who have none.</p>

	<p>We raise food for ourselves, volunteers, and a local soup kitchen. We’re working toward a sustainable integrated farm that minimizes wastes and purchased inputs. We have herb and vegetable gardens, goats, pigs, rabbits and chickens, and we harvest firewood and lumber from our woods.</p>
