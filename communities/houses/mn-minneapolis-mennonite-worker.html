	<p>The Mennonite Worker is an urban intentional community committed to following Jesus' way of hospitality, simplicity, prayer, peacemaking, and resistance. We are a Mennonite congregation whose way of life together is deeply influenced by the Catholic Worker movement. 
	
	<p>Our current work includes operating two houses of hospitality, gardening, and a variety of organizing and educational projects through the Gene Stoltzfus Center for Creative Peacemaking, which is located at the lower level of Simone Weil House.

	    The Mennonite Worker often has room for folks interested in sharing in our work. To find our more, visit www.mennoniteworker.com
