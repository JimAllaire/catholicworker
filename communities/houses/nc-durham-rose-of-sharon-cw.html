		<p>We are a new Catholic Worker House located in Durham, North Carolina--Rose of Sharon Catholic Worker. We strive to live the Gospel by building community, rejecting militarism and consumerism, and living close to the land. We provide hospitality to women and children, and our hope is to create an atmosphere where everyone feels as if they are part of a family. We can use help with household work, yard work, vegetable gardening, sustainability projects, food donations, gas cards, and assistance with our guests (tutoring for adults and kids, transportation, job search connections, resume writing skills).  Please contact us to inquire about available space if you are considering being part of our community. </p>
