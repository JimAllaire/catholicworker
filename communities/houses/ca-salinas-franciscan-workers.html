	    The Companions of the Way are part of the Franciscan Workers of Junipero Serra, who serve as the staff of Dorothy's Place Hospitality Center in Salinas, CA. The Companions work as full-time volunteers with people living on the street and we live together in a Community inspired and informed by the Catholic Worker movement.
	<p>
	With love, respect and compassion, the Franciscan Workers of Junipero Serra provide essential services and transitional support to people experiencing the injustice of homelessness and extreme poverty. Some of our Companions are here to work for social justice, some as an expression of deeply held spiritual values that lead us to serve our fellows, and some because we value living in Community as part of our personal growth. We are also committed to living simply and mindfully.
