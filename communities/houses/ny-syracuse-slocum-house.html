	    Slocum House Catholic Worker in Syracuse, NY is looking for one more full-time live in community member to share in the work of hospitality, house chores, general repairs, and a monthly financial contribution. The house continues to work with Jail Ministry and is currently offering hospitality to a limited number of women being released from the city jail with nowhere else to go. Prefer a female community member. Also would prefer a two-year commitment. Community members are also involved with peace and social justice activism, including the anti-drone campaign at the gates of Hancock Airbase. If interested in a discernment visit, please call Bonny or Pete at 315-475-2811.</p>
