	<p>The Denver Catholic Worker community has been providing hospitality since 1978 to folks experiencing homelessness. We lost our home to fire in 2016 and were finally able to replace it in 2018 with an old four-bedroom house, also centrally located near downtown Denver. Our "new" home is in the midst of Emmaus Housing, a low-income rental housing program started by CW-related folks in 1999. Emmaus owns the Catholic Worker house, in order to keep it off the housing market in perpetuity. The Catholic Worker raised the cost of the purchase and repairs, and is tremendously grateful to everyone who contributed.</p>
	
	<p>We have been slowed down by zoning issues, but are finally now open. Our two smallest bedrooms are occupied by long-term single residents, and we intend to use the other bedrooms for families with immigration issues. Our CW core community, two of whom live next door and others scattered through the Denver area, meets weekly at the house for fellowship and prayer. We welcome volunteer help as needed, but the house is so small that it's largely resident-operated.</p>
