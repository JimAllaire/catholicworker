	<p>We're gearing up to buy a new hospitality house! It will be smaller than the old one but just as centrally located near downtown Denver. It's in the midst of Emmaus Housing, a low-income rental housing project that a group of CW-related folks started in 1999 and is still operating. Our plan is that Emmaus Housing will own the new house, protecting it as attainable housing for very-low-income folks in perpetuity, and the CW will use it as a CW hospitality house. Please see our homepage and gofundme if you'd like to contribute.</p>
