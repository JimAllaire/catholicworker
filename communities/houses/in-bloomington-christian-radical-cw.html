	<p>The Bloomington Christian Radical CW is an ecumenical Christian community that tries to live, pray and work both with each other and with the poor we encounter.  We try to offer housing, food, clothing and love to people facing homelessness.  We perform the works of mercy and nonviolently oppose the works of war.  We strive to practice the Sermon on the Mount, community living, voluntary poverty, personalism, and care for the environment.  We have families and children here, all trying to build community together.	We love hosting visitors and prospective volunteers so give us a call.

	<p><i>Consider contacting the Bloomington Christian Radical / Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
