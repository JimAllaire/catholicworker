		<p>Founded in early 2017 in response to the call of Pope Francis during the Year of Mercy that every diocese have a place for those recovering from sin and addiction the Matt Talbot House is for people who are desirous of a life of deeper conversion to Christ and a life of service to those most in need.

		<p>The foundation of our community life is the liturgy of the hours, lectio divina, and the Rosary, as well as Mass on Tuesdays and Sundays. A person who wants to come for less than a month does not need to get a job here and can just volunteer on the farm and around the house and support the life of prayer and service. Longer term residents would need to seek employment to contribute as any ordinary layperson would.

		<p>Current apostolates include: Catechesis at Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) and Dixon Correctional Institute. Also, St. Vincent De Paul service in E. Feliciana Parish. Apostolate to the sick and dying is also part of our commitment.

		<p>E. Feliciana parish is one of the poorest in Louisiana and the Matt Talbot House is located in a poor, rural area. We invite people from the community for common prayer. This is not a half-way house or a treatment center, however, it is definitely a supportive environment for a practicing Catholic who views himself as a recovering sinner and will support those in need of 12-step meetings and other resources. The house is a house of prayer and thus is a semi-contemplative atmosphere but it is not a monastery as the community is involved in many active works in the region.

		<p>The owner of the house and property is employed as the Associate Director for the Office of Evangelization and &Catechesis in the Diocese of Baton Rouge. Please email or call Barry Schoedel for more information.
		
		<p><i>Consider contacting the Matt Talbot House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i></p>
