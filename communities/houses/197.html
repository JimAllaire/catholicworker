	    Guadalupe is a small town on California's Central Coast with a high population of immigrants and farmworkers. Beatitude House is a community of volunteers from various backgrounds, all committed to serving Guadalupe's low-income residents. Beatitude House's current programs for direct service include: food, clothing and furniture distribution; medical clinic; medical and social service advocacy; and a summer day camp for kids. In line with the Catholic Worker philosophy of not merely serving the poor but also resisting war and other social injustices that perpetuate poverty, Beatitude House conducts regular vigils and civil disobedience at Vandenburg Air Force Base.
