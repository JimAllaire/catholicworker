	<p>Simone Weil and Peter Maurin House – Monastic (Catholic Worker’s “Little Monastery”) of a non-dogmatic and non-denominational orientation; founded and established between 2009 -2011.</p>

	<p>“a Library of books and films – in a House of Silence” – which provides environment for inner work towards living in true communion with God; in His Truth about life, reality and the world. (Repentance, prayer, Knowledge, inner healing.)
	Simple –“of old way”- life in the House (and learning it). A small garden.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this House is:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>to further the aims and goals of the Catholic Worker movement as expressed by Dorothy Day and, particularly, as expressed by Peter Maurin;</li>

		<li>to join in works and efforts of the newly established (in 2004) New Monastic
	Movement (please check: NewMonasticism.org);</li>
	
		<li>to follow in the footsteps of the Madonna Houses (founded by Catherine de Hueck Doherty; and as expressed by her in the book ”</li>
		
		<li>to learn about, draw from-and follow- the examples of the other deeply rooted in God spiritual/ religious monastic or life-communities; – the ancient Essenes, or the Bruderhof, or Amish and Hutterites;</li>
		
		<li>to live as one unique small monastic community as a response to God’s call – for repentance and “conversion”; and then for living a way of love – which will bring fruits of truth, justice, and peace.</li>
		
	</ul>

	<p>If you are interested in our mission, inquire about the situation by calling and coming for few days-to two weeks of orientation. In the beautiful House-setting there is a room for one person for a longer-term stay (half-a-year to a year or more), and a room for one – for a shorter-term stay.</p>
