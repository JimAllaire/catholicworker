		<p><b>Su Casa Catholic Worker</b> provides hospitality and a healing environment for homeless Latino families, reaches out to our local community through our weekly soup kitchen and recreation programs for kids and engages in education and action to work for social justice. In the tradition of the Catholic Worker Movement, we strive for a simple, non-violent and sustainable lifestyle. Each worker's responsibilities vary according to skills and interests. Every worker assists with house managing, which involves welcoming visitors, accepting donations, providing childcare, and being present to our guests.

		<p><i>Consider contacting the Su Casa Catholic Worker Community to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
