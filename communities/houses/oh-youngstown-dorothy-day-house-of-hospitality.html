		    The Dorothy Day House, at 620 Belmont Ave in Youngstown, offers hospitality four times a week. Dinner is served Monday-Thursday from 5:00 to 6:30 PM, and free showers are offered on Tuesday evenings from 2:00 to 4:45 PM. Roundtable discussions of social justice topics are held on the fourth Thursday evening of the month at 7:00 PM, and we meet for Vespers on Wednesdays at 7:00 PM. We are a relatively new Catholic Worker community (we opened our doors in November 2009) who strive to be grounded in the works of mercy, hospitality and nonviolence.
