	<p>TBT is a lay religious order with the goal of doing the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. It has a mission to improve health care wherever it operates. Such improvement relies on the participation of patients and medical care providers with the goal that everyone will have access to health care, and everyone will pay their fair share of the costs. Currently, our public and private systems do not collect nor distribute the money they get from taxes and from premiums to assure that everyone has access to quality health care. Those who currently control the political process do not want to replace the private system and do not want to pay for universal health care if they must make sacrifices in other domestic and military budgets. It does not appear that the health care reform desires of the public and the medical care providers are going to be met by political means. Consequently, we help to organize patients and providers of medical services needed at the local level to solve the problems related to caring for all patients in a community. We do it for about half the cost of other private and public programs with no out-of-pocket costs for patient members. Usually, existing associations and churches take the lead in such needed grass roots developments. TBT is that kind of grass roots organization.
