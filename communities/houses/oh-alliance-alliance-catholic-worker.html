	<p>The Alliance Catholic Worker Joshua Casteel House is made up of very dedicated  volunteers who live and work in the surrounding community. We currently provide hospitality three days a week by serving meals. We hold round table discussions every month, and plan together as a community. We are currently renovating our facilities to accommodate a live in Worker community to be completed in the near future.</p>
