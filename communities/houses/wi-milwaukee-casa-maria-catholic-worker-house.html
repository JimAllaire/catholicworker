	<p><STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
	    	<p>Casa Maria is seeking live-in volunteers for our four houses in Milwaukee. Our houses take in homeless women, families, refugees, and asylees. We redistribute used furniture, clothing, and infant items to those in need and participate in urban gardening. Our goal is to soon open a house for people who have been unfairly targeted by Milwaukee's privatized, child welfare system. We regularly protest militarism, war taxes, gun violence, welfare deform, and have ties to groups work
Casa Maria is seeking live-in volunteers for our four houses in Milwaukee. Our houses take in homeless women, families, refugees, and asylees. We redistribute used furniture, clothing, and infant items to those in need and participate in urban gardening. Two of our four houses are dedicated for families who have been unfairly targeted by Milwaukee's privatized, racist, child welfare system. We regularly protest militarism, war taxes, gun violence, welfare deform, and have ties to groups working on racial justice and immigration issues. Those interested can contact
