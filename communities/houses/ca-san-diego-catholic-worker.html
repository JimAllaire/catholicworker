			<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
			The San Diego Catholic Worker, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, is growing and about to open a House of Hospitality. We are looking for two or three people (a couple would be ideal) to live in the house as a focal point for the activities of the membership at large. We are hoping to find people who are familiar with the Catholic Worker way of serving the poor and building a more just society, and who have lived in a House of Hospitality or have been attached to a Catholic Worker community for some time. Ideally, volunteers should have a good working knowledge of Spanish and be available to make a commitment for at least one year. Room and board and a stipend, if necessary, will be provided.

			You can read about the history of the San Diego Catholic Worker and its newspaper by referring to our Website:

			People who are interested should address their inquiries to denyshorgan@att.net
