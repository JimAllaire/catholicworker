		<p>Mission - Mary the Apostle House, in the tradition of the Catholic Worker movement founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, and inspired by monasticism is a community committed to prayer, nonviolence, and environmental sustainability.  We are learning an alternative way of life  one that is in tune with the Gospel.  We stand in solidarity with those who struggle in and against poverty and systemic injustice.  With profound hope for a renewed and transformed world, we resist forces of destruction, death and oppression by living hospitality, reverence for all creation, and witness for justice and peace.

		<p>Works - Active resistance to war as a community and in concert with other local peace and justice organizations, food pantry, shared meals, and experimenting in urban gardening.

		<p><i>Consider contacting the Mary the Apostle Catholic Worker to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i>
