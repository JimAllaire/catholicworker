	<p>The Ames Romero house is a community of people who live sustainably, creatively, and in solidarity with those in our Ames community seeking refuge or spiritual sanctuary. We invite those transitioning from homelessness, incarceration, or inadequate/unstable housing to stay with us for a longer term to be part of a safe and stable home.  While staying at the Romero House, there is no rent, no judgement, and no expectations; only love, acceptance, and peace. Our mission stems from the encounter with the human person and our belief that the intrinsic dignity Jesus preaches is a love for each person in action.</p>
