		<p>We are a non-sectarian community, not based in prayer or religious doctrine, affiliated with the Catholic Worker movement through many years of personal association, and a deeply shared ethical and social vision. Our common purpose is to explore and demonstrate an ecologically sustainable way of life within a city, based on agricultural use of yards and open land, and a simple common life, to minimize our consumption of world resources. We also practice radical direct action for justice and peace and use our houses and land for education about peacemaking and the nonviolent way of life we seek to develop.</p>
		
		<p>We have a network of seven houses in an inner-city Nashville neighborhood, with about an acre and a half of land, and housing for two dozen residents. Each household is autonomous. We welcome visits and inquiries from people interested in our ideas and practice, and occasionally have openings for like-minded people interested in joining us as residents.</p>

		<p><strong> Great CW Community opportunity at Nashville Greenlands</strong>
		<p>SEEKING:	Two CW families to spin off our ownership of two of the seven houses in our network. Very 
		agreeable terms. Two, four-bedroom houses in excellent, restored condition.
		<p>WHY:  I am nearing age 84, after 64 years of active engagement with three CW communities. My elderly 
		partner, Pam Beziat, and I need to spin off our responsibility for these two houses, and prepare for good 
		transitions while we still can.
		<p>WHERE: These are two of five vacant houses we bought and restored in a historic African-American 
		community, starting twenty-four years ago. The neighborhood is being assaulted by gentrification.
		<p>OUR COMMUNITY: 	<p>Ownership of other autonomous houses in our network is already spun off to 
		young local activists. We do not presently do classic CW hospitality for people in distress, but our 
		members are deeply engaged as co-founders and/or key workers in five small non-profits that do direct 
		service and advocacy for poor people and for justice in general:
		<p>A) OpenTableNashville.org  - service outreach and advocacy for many homeless friends.                            
		<p>B) NashvilleFoodProject.org - food rescue, and meal preparation and distribution for poor people 
		experiencing food insecurity.
		<p>C) WorkersDignity.org - organizing and advocacy to prevent wage theft and gain better 	conditions for 
		immigrant workers and public transportation workers.
		<p>D) Interfaith Power & Light ( Facebook -@NashvilleTIPL ) - organizing among church groups for clean 
		energy and environmental responsibility.
		<p>E) NashvillePeaceJustice.org - a coalition of local organizations working on many justice and peace issues.
		<p>OUR COMMUNITY COMPLEXION:
		-  Four seniors, two middle-aged, fifteen young people, two babies.
		- Two risen-away Catholics, one Quaker/Buddhist, one former Mormon, one former JW, three 	Church 
		of Christ, one Jew, one Methodist, others of unknown religious background, but most 	came to us 
		because of attraction to classic CW social ethics.
		- Eight African-American heritage, twelve European heritage, one Latin American.
		<p>NASHVILLE: 	A booming metropolis, with lots of work opportunities, and great needs for housing and 
		justice advocacy, in a state with a deeply reactionary government.

		<!-- <center><p><b> NASHVILLE GREENLANDS<br>
		Resident Volunteer Opportunities  - Long Term</p></center>

		<p> One opening, beginning mid-August 2018, and occasional openings as current residents move out to other commitments and housing.</b></p>
		
		<p>Nashville Greenlands is an intentional residential community devoted to urban agriculture and social justice action. We have a network of seven houses we have restored in a poor neighborhood in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
		<p>For the resident volunteer opportunities above, we are looking for people with a convincing commitment to a simple, just, and environmentally sensitive way of life, and to advocacy and activism for social justice and world peace.</p>
		<p>Our community structure is decentralized and non-directive. Housing and utilities are provided free in exchange for thirty hours per month of help with gardening and housing maintenance, under the guidance of the household coordinator. Beyond this commitment, residents choose their own areas of action and employment. Current residents are key organizers and activists in other community organizations devoted to outreach and service to homeless people, labor organizing and support among exploited immigrant workers, collection and distribution of surplus food to communities in need, criminal justice reform, environmental conservation, and world peace advocacy.</p>
