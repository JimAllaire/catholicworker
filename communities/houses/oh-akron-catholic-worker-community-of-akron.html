	<p>Catholic Worker Akron (CWA) has been present in Akron for twenty years. Our core ministry is hospitality to women and children with a heavy emphasis on immigrants. We currently provide housing and direct service. We have and are in cooperation with other grassroots groups who are in service to the neighborhood. We have consciously endeavored to be a “good neighbor” and are well integrated into the local community. We strongly believe that Catholic Worker’s presence in Akron is and has been a blessing to all. We are well supported by the larger community.</p>

	<p>While we operate as an “organism” more so than an organization – we do have a strong organization. We are open to the work of the Holy Spirit. Our greatest hope is that the principles of the Gospel as lived by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin be followed.</p>
