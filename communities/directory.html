<h3>Directory of Catholic Worker Communities</h3>

<P><I>Catholic Workers live a simple lifestyle in community, serve the poor, and 
resist war and social injustice. Most are grounded in the Gospel, prayer, and 
the Catholic faith, although some houses on this list state that they are 
interfaith. Each Catholic Worker house is independent and there is no "Catholic 
Worker headquarters".</I> 
<P><I>Income for Catholic Worker houses can come from outside jobs held by 
members or by cottage industries developed by the community, but most houses 
survive on donations. Every Catholic Worker house can use donations of money 
and/or specific items like food, clothing, etc...Most can also use volunteers 
from the surrounding community to help with the work. If you feel called to do 
something about poverty and homelessness in your community, your local Catholic 
Worker house would be a great place to start. This is a list of all the Catholic 
Worker communities that we know about, indexed by state or country. </I></p>

    Guadalupe is a small town on California's Central Coast with a high population of immigrants and farmworkers.

Beatitude House's current programs for direct service include: food, clothing and furniture distribution; medical clinic; medical and social service advocacy; and a summer day camp for kids.

    We serve the working poor of Los Angeles and are building a movement for a living wage. We distribute food to the homes of immigrant workers. We support whistle-blowers who stand up for their rights at their jobs. We offer our house of hospitality to those in need. And we do resistance work: organizing students, workers and community to fight for a living wage. We need volunteers who want to live communally, grow spiritually, and join the movement.

The Companions work as full-time volunteers with people living on the street and we live together in a Community inspired and informed by the Catholic Worker movement.
<p>
With love, respect and compassion, the Franciscan Workers of Junipero Serra provide essential services and transitional support to people experiencing the injustice of homelessness and extreme poverty. Some of our Companions are here to work for social justice, some as an expression of deeply held spiritual values that lead us to serve our fellows, and some because we value living in Community as part of our personal growth. We are also committed to living simply and mindfully.

    The L.A. Catholic Worker is a lay Catholic community of men and women which operates a free soup kitchen, hospitality house for the homeless, AIDS ministry, hospice for the dying, newspaper, and regularly offers prophetic witness in opposition to war-making and injustice. Each summer mid-June through early August, the L.A. Catholic Worker extends an invitation to any adult interested in joining us for a period of six weeks during the summer. It is an opportunity to live and work with a gospel-based community, to discern one's vocation, or just simply to deepen one's social justice experience on a first hand basis. By the way, the weather here in Southern California is great too.

<p>David House is an intentional community associated with Martin De Porres House of  Hospitality in San Francisco. Martin’s as we affectionately call it was started in December 1971. Since its inception it has been a House of Hospitality in the Catholic Worker tradition. We have grown into a community of people with diverse spiritual practices, but our mission remains the same---“to serve others in the spirit of compassion, understanding and love.” We are an aging community so we are actively seeking young, energetic people, particularly women or couples to come join us in our work at Martins and living in community. Why not come and see if this is where you are being called to serve?</p>

    The Oakland Catholic Worker serves members of the Latin American immigrant and refugee community as they establish themselves in our East Oakland neighborhood.  We provide temporary housing and accompaniment, hot meals, groceries, English classes, cultural events, and other services to people in need. In solidarity with those we serve, we struggle to change the unjust structures of our society through social activism.

    	We are accepting applications for full-time live-in staff members at our house of hospitality for Latin American immigrants. Staff members receive room and board and a stipend, commit for at least a year, should speak Spanish, and will primarily focus on accompaniment/case management for our guests and coordinating our English as a second language classes. Secondary responsibilities could include working with our food programs; managing our newsletter, website, and social media; outreach and advocacy; fundraising; bookkeeping, data-entry, and finances; volunteer coordination; and maintenance of the house, yard, and garden. Begin winter/summer 2018.</p>

<p>The Denver Catholic Worker House community is tremendously grateful to everyone who has contributed to our rebuilding following the January fire. We've been hoping for a long time that we were about to get another house, but if so, it doesn't look imminent. We're staying together as a community, doing limited hospitality in some of our homes, and some of us are pouring lots of energy into creating tiny home villages in Denver (one is up and running). If another big house becomes a possibility for us, we'll let you know.</p>

    The St. Damien Catholic Worker is committed to living the radical Gospel of Jesus in Hawaii.

Following in the footsteps of St. Damien, we are called to serve our neglected and marginalized neighbors.

Following in the footsteps of Dorothy Day, we are called to welcome our brothers and sisters with hospitality and solidarity.

Following in the footsteps of Peter Maurin, we are called to advocate for the respectful use of the land and sustainable farming and to foster dialogue for a greater understanding of the problems facing Hawaii and the world.

Following in the footsteps of the non-violent Jesus, we are called to seek peace, justice and an end to oppression and militarism in all their forms.

<p>

    Our founder and resident director is 63 and has known of the Catholic Worker Movement since 1977 and has always hoped to buy a House to use as a CW House. He was finally been able to buy our first and only house so far, this St. Isidore CW Cottage, which is now full to capacity with two formerly homeless vets and two other formerly homeless men, and Tom. The House pays its expenses with Tom's Pension and, so far, with spot labor and donations.  While we are open to persons of all faiths and no-faith, both to serve and to be helped, our inspiration and community prayer-life is Catholic.  Our Catholic Diocese has gifted us the funds to be registered as a non-profit, so that the VA might stipend us a per-diem for every Vet to whom we provide a home in the CW tradition.  Much of that per-diem we hope to use to subsidize wages to our residents to be employee-member-owners of our affiliated, for-profit workshop: Vets'-Green-Energy-Co-Ops, to install and maintain de-centralized heating, cooling, and electricity co-generating capacity at our and other CW Houses, and at FBC's (Faith-Based Communities) around the country. 

<p>

<p>

	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
     We seek distance-volunteers to open their homes to homeless vets -- of which there are 400,000 at any given time -- in revocable or irrevocable living trusts -- under our umbrella. Also, to help us compile contact information for FBCs in your part of the country, or at least, to order and to forward to us the current phone books from one or more cities in your State, so that we may compile such lists, to promote not only the St.MCW charism, but also the whole CW life-style, as well as de-centralized energy production and use, in the tradition of Peter Maurin's farming communes and workshops with Houses of Hospitality

<p>	Simone Weil and Peter Maurin House – Monastic (Catholic Worker’s “Little Monastery”) of a non-dogmatic and non-denominational orientation; founded and established between 2009 -2011.</p>

   <p>“a Library of books and films – in a House of Silence” – which provides environment for inner work towards living in true communion with God; in His Truth about life, reality and the world. (Repentance, prayer, Knowledge, inner healing.)
Simple –“of old way”- life in the House (and learning it). A small garden.</p>

<p>The purpose of this House is:<p>
<ul>
<li>to further the aims and goals of the Catholic Worker movement as expressed by Dorothy Day and, particularly, as expressed by Peter Maurin;</li>
	
<li>to join in works and efforts of the newly established (in 2004) New Monastic
Movement (please check: NewMonasticism.org);</li>
<li>to follow in the footsteps of the Madonna Houses (founded by Catherine de Hueck Doherty; and as expressed by her in the book ”</li>
<li>to learn about, draw from-and follow- the examples of the other deeply rooted in God spiritual/ religious monastic or life-communities; – the ancient Essenes, or the Bruderhof, or Amish and Hutterites;</li>
<li>to live as one unique small monastic community as a response to God’s call – for repentance and “conversion”; and then for living a way of love – which will bring fruits of truth, justice, and peace.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in our mission, inquire about the situation by calling and coming for few days-to two weeks of orientation. In the beautiful House-setting there is a room for one person for a longer-term stay (half-a-year to a year or more), and a room for one – for a shorter-term stay.</p>

<p>

    The Shalom Catholic Worker House is a community of diverse people living under one roof, striving to bring about an occasional glimpse of the Kingdom of God. We provide hospitality to 25 homeless men and promote issues of peace and justice.

<p>

<p>

	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
    We are looking for volunteers who would like to join our community for 6 months or longer. Young people are especially encouraged to consider working and living with us. Responsibilities of community members include helping with chores, attending to the needs of our homeless guests, and engaging in peace and justice activities (as much as you are comfortable with). Community members are encouraged to have a part-time job outside of the house. Benefits include getting to know some of the best and most interesting people ever--those who live in our community, those who come to volunteer with us, our homeless guests and our neighbors. Before a commitment is made, we ask those interested to come and spend a week or a weekend with us so we can discern together if a longer commitment seems right. For more information about our house, please visit www.shalomcw.org or call Brad at 913-321-2206.

<p>Website: <a href="http://www.matttalbot.house" target="_blank">Matt Talbot Catholic Worker</a></p>

<p>Founded in early 2017 in response to the call of Pope Francis during the Year of Mercy that every diocese have a place for those recovering from sin and addiction the Matt Talbot House is for people who are desirous of a life of deeper conversion to Christ and a life of service to those most in need.</p>

<p>The foundation of our community life is the liturgy of the hours, lectio divina, and the Rosary, as well as Mass on Tuesdays and Sundays. A person who wants to come for less than a month does not need to get a job here and can just volunteer on the farm and around the house and support the life of prayer and service. Longer term residents would need to seek employment to contribute as any ordinary layperson would.</p>

<p>Current apostolates include: Catechesis at Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) and Dixon Correctional Institute. Also, St. Vincent De Paul service in E. Feliciana Parish. Apostolate to the sick and dying is also part of our commitment.</p>

<p>E. Feliciana parish is one of the poorest in Louisiana and the Matt Talbot House is located in a poor, rural area. We invite people from the community for common prayer. This is not a half-way house or a treatment center, however, it is definitely a supportive environment for a practicing Catholic who views himself as a recovering sinner and will support those in need of 12-step meetings and other resources. The house is a house of prayer and thus is a semi-contemplative atmosphere but it is not a monastery as the community is involved in many active works in the region.</p>

<p>The owner of the house and property is employed as the Associate Director for the Office of Evangelization and Catechesis in the Diocese of Baton Rouge. Please email or call Barry Schoedel for more information.</p>

    We are looking for 3-6 summer interns for 2014 to live in our intentional community while working in Boston�s oldest soup kitchen. Interns will be expected to work 2-3 shifts in the soup kitchen, where they will cook and share a meal with guests and fellow volunteers. Interns will also be given a secondary placement. Examples of secondary placements include our urban garden project, the McKinley Garden, our cooking class series, Take Back the Kitchen, and our pay-what-you-can meal series, Community Tables. For more information and application materials, visit our website: http://haleyhouse.org/internships.shtml
<p>Haley House is also seeking long-term live-in community members.

<p>The New Bedford Catholic Worker is a forming urban lay CW community,
fueled by the Holy Spirit. In keeping with tradition of the CW movement we
intend to live simply, provide hospitality to the poor and conduct
Corporal and Spiritual works of Mercy. This historic city can benefit from
our future Soup Kitchen and Day Shelter. We plan to peacefully assemble on
issues of Worker Justice, Social Justice and overall Injustice. Those
interested in voluntary poverty, supplication, communal living,
prayer/fasting, tax resistance and non participation in
capitalism/consumerism; all while in line with CST and the "Aims and
Means" of the CW movement. Please contact us to assist in sharing the work
to form this community. If willing to donate assets or allow for the
temporary use of land for farming/gardening, housing or commercial space
we would love to hear from you. To receive our newsletter or to simply
wish us well, please email, call or text.</p>

<p><b>Volunteers needed:</b><br>
	The New Bedford Catholic Worker is currently only seeking "local/regional" member/volunteers at this time. While we do encourage participatory relocation to NB we currently do not live in community or have a suitable base to operate out of. We do need others to help establish our work here in New Bedford. If you feel called to service here in the south coast region of Massachusetts, we would love to hear from you. God willing, we can attract enough people to pool resources & someday obtain a house. We apologize in advance to all other potential long distance volunteers who are looking to land somewhere; please pray with us for the future success of the NBCW. </p>

</p> We will serve our most marginalized brothers and sisters in Christ with
Dignity and Love. Come join us..    Pax et Bonum </p>

	<p>Restoration Farm began in 2015 with the inspiration of Dorothy Day, Peter Maurin, and Catherine Doherty of Madonna House. Under the patronage of the Blessed Mother and Saint Isidore the Farmer, we grow buckwheat and a variety of vegetables as well as raise Katahdin sheep, dairy goats, pigs, and chickens. The mission of the farm is to grow and directly provide a variety of foods to individuals, food pantries, and soup kitchens. By sharing the fruit of the earth and work of our hands, we love our neighbor. We believe rural living and active participation with the Church calendar is a living catechesis. Restoration Farm is intended to be an educational site for rural life and the social justice issue of food security as well as a place to participate in the corporal works of mercy. We host several gatherings a year including celebrations of rural life and book studies. Weekly, we host a bible study and Rosary for women. Aside from the host family, we have accommodations for one resident farm family, which currently is occupied. Please email or check out our Facebook page to inquire about gatherings, bible study/Rosary times, and volunteer opportunities during the summer months which include work in the fields and distribution of food./p>

<p>At Hildegard House we welcome and offer hospitality to those who have experienced human trafficking and are in need of a safe place to rest and heal. We strive to love and learn from each other, focus on the goodness in each person and support the growth and wholeness of all. </p>

<p>Rooted in the Catholic Worker tradition, we embrace the God-given dignity of all creation. As Catholic Workers, we recognize the universality of the call to love one another which manifests itself in the teaching of the great faith-filled traditions. and we resist violence in all its forms. Hildegard House is not tax exempt. Through our faith in the Spirit, we look to the generosity of our friends and neighbors to sustain the work.</p>

<p>We are a small Catholic Worker house offering hospitality to women who have survived exploitation through human trafficking. We are committed to comforting the afflicted and equally as important, afflicting the comfortable. We hold a monthly Clarification of Thought, actively participate in the regional Catholic Worker retreats in non-violent resistance, and we ally with local grassroots groups that resist exploitation and work for peace and justice. We strive to deepen our faith and nurture our spirituality individually and collectively. </p>

<p><STRONG>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</STRONG> We are in need of 2 live-in women volunteers, to share in welcoming and caring for our guests and attending to the house needs. Basic helpful skills include: good listening, and ability to stand with and empower our guests. Our guests, live-in volunteers and extended community supporters engage in regular fun, community building activities such as spa night, a craft making. We encourage our volunteers to participate to whatever extent comfortable, in all the tenets of the catholic worker movement which includes Clarification of Thought and resisting violence in all of its forms.<p>

<p>We would prefer a minimal commitment of 6 months and if it seems like a good fit, encourage you to stay longer. Room and board is free and there is room to pursue part-time employment or other personal interests. Our house is located in a residential neighborhood, is close to the downtown area, and public transportation is easily accessible.</p>
<p>Did I mention that we have multiple garden sites and we are mentored by elders in organic, sustainable and communal farming practices?</p>
<p>If interested, contact Michele Naar-Obed, (218) 722-2231, or email; hildegardhouseduluthcw@gmail.com, or message us through facebook; Hildegard House Duluth Catholic Worker.<p>

    Loaves and Fishes Community was founded in 1989 by Angie Miller and the late Steve O'Neil. It is inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement as well as northern Minnesota traditions of community and labor organizing. Our work includes family-style hospitality to people experiencing homelessness; transitional housing for men with criminal backgrounds; a no-money community bicycle shop; homeless outreach; and grassroots organizing for safe and affordable housing.

<p>

	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
    	<p>There are currently six members of our core community and three members in formation. We can accommodate up to three more live-in volunteers and would love to explore that possibility with you! All people are welcome, and we are particularly interested in hearing from people of color and people with experience in the mental health field (Duluth is facing a severe shortage of mental health providers, which is evident in our daily work). </p>

		<p>We live between four nearby houses in a quiet residential neighborhood just east of downtown Duluth. We welcome people of all faiths and are LGBTI- and family-friendly. We strive to balance our workload so members can pursue part-time work or school in addition to their daily commitments to the community. Decisions are made collectively and we actively study nonviolent communication to improve the quality of our relationships with each other. Room and board is covered and long-term members tithe 10% of their income back to the community. There is no stipend and we do not provide health insurance, but Minnesota has generous public plans. We ask potential new members to join us for a 3-month trial period before making a commitment.</p>

		<p>Duluth has a thriving arts culture and tends blue-collar Left in politics. We are close to nature and blocks away from Lake Superior. That said, it does get really cold in the winter (but green and gorgeous in the summer!).</P>

    <p>We are an intentional community and house of hospitality in South Minneapolis.&#160; We are inspired by peace movements including the Civil Rights Movement, the Catholic Worker Movement, and the Food Justice Movement.&#160; Most of all, we are motivated by good conversations shared over meals and humble, challenging love. </p>

<p><strong>Our Projects:</strong> </p>

<p>We have been cooking and serving meals at a street corner near our house on Thursday and Friday nights.&#160; Our meals accompany a weekly event known as the Amen Corner put on by the Ventura Village Neighborhood Association (our neighborhood).&#160; The Amen Corner is a two hour-long open mic meant to act as a space to foster positive change in our community. </p>

<p>We invest a lot of time and thought into gardening, home-based food production, and ethical food purchasing.&#160; We raise chickens, do compost and vermiculture,&#160; extend the harvest through canning, freezing, and preserving, and we try to either get food for free, grow it ourselves, or buy it local and organic. </p>

<p>We work with friends to plan roundtable discussions about topics that we believe to be positive and life-giving.&#160; We have so far had roundtables on heterosexual privilege/transgender identities, racism within our American school system, and Catholic Womanpriests. </p>

<p>We also host people who are either homeless, refugees, or in a period of transition. </p>

<p>The four core community members also practice a common purse.&#160; This means that we share the money we earn at jobs outside the house and pay for our needs collectively.</p>

    Trinity Hills is a ministry of the Catholic Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, established on March 25, 2011—the Feast of the Annunciation. We are a center for prayer and service.  Our efforts are inspired by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day, co-founders of the Catholic Worker movement. Located in unincorporated Greene County, Trinity Hills is about a twenty minute drive from Springfield, MO.
<p>Every day, the staff at Trinity Hills prays the Liturgy of the Hours for the intentions of our Bishop, Pope Francis and all those who have asked us to pray for their particular needs. If you have a prayer intention, please contact us.
<p>
Located on 126 acres of hills, forest, prairie and river-lands, our primary works are: the Liturgy of the Hours, Adoration, providing hospitality for homeless families, producing food for the hungry (45,000 eggs donated as of September 2016), and shepherding a herd of ancient Jacob sheep. Animals have been reduced to factory machinery by factory farming; our goal is to have animals that maintain their God-given nature while producing food for those we serve.

    We are a 4 acre farm/orchard in Southwestern Montana - south of Missoula (location of the University of Montana). We are an intentional community practicing simple, sustainable community living and exploring renewable energy and recycling. We offer individual retreat space to Catholic Worker workers. We manage an orchard and an expanding garden to produce our food and excess for the homeless shelter in Missoula. Community members work with fragile children, for the church's Newman Center and at the homeless shelter.

<p>

    <p>At St. Joseph's House of Hospitality, the sources of our spirit and the direction are the teachings of Jesus and the founding work of Dorothy Day.  Since 1941, we have been an independent, non-profit organization, sustained by the donations and financial contribution of individuals and groups.  We accept no funds from the government.  We are rooted in the belief that through God we are provided with our daily needs.</p>
<p>Consistent with the philosophy of the Catholic Worker Movement, we share our hope for a "new society," a new way of being with one another.  People who come to this house are "guests," ambassadors of God.  We attempt to form the community through commitment to the following:
<ul><li>Acceptance of the personal
<li>Obligation of attending to the needs of our brothers and sisters
<li>A daily practice of the works of mercy - feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, visiting the imprisoned, comforting the sorrowful
<li>The practice of non-violent witness for peace and justice.</ul></p>

<p>

<p>

	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
    Our Catholic Worker House of Hospitality serves a hot meal daily for about 100 people. We provide hospitality year round and winter emergency shelter. Room, board, and a stipend may be available for catholic workers. If interested, contact marc.d.leonard@gmail.com or call (585) 232 - 3262.

<p>	St. Francis Farm Community’s mission is to live a sustainable life based on the Gospels and on Catholic Worker principles as an alternative to the consumer culture.  The community provides practical assistance, prayerful presence and a place for reflection to help others simplify their lives. For more information see our website, www.stfrancisfarm.org</p>

	<p>We’re all volunteers; we live together intentionally, sharing work, meals, and time for silent prayer and reflection. The current core community is a Quaker family. We welcome people of all faiths, and people who have none.</p>

	<p>We raise food for ourselves, volunteers, and a local soup kitchen. We’re working toward a sustainable integrated farm that minimizes wastes and purchased inputs. We have herb and vegetable gardens, goats, pigs, rabbits and chickens, and we harvest firewood and lumber from our woods.</p>
<p>
	<b>Volunteers needed:</b><br>
	We seek volunteers to help with farm and woods work between April and October.  If you want to learn about sustainable agriculture and build practical skills, or just to work with your hands and enjoy nature, consider volunteering with us.</p>

	<p>We expect volunteers to be respectful of people with different backgrounds, ideologies, abilities and disabilities; to work through conflicts; to refrain from proselytizing; and to abstain from alcohol, drugs, and sexual activity outside marriage while they are with us.</p>

	<p>Day visitors/volunteers are welcome; please call ahead and let us know you’re coming.   Overnight volunteers begin with a visit between Monday and Saturday.  There is no minimum time commitment, and the initial time can be extended by mutual agreement. Please read our Volunteers page (http://www.stfrancisfarm.org/Volunteers.html )</p>

    The Community of the Franciscan Way (CFW) is a Catholic Worker and Mission of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina. We seek a life of prayer, humility, simplicity, and voluntary poverty alongside the poor. Committed to the Catholic Worker movement, founded in 1933 by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day, we advocate for personalism, a decentralized society, and a green revolution through nonviolence, the works of mercy, manual labor, and voluntary poverty. Eleven permanent residents currently live in our Catholic Worker farm house, and our Christ Room is available nightly for temporary guests. Funds and donations are directly used for the performance of the corporeal and spiritual works of mercy, and no one in the House draws any compensation from contributions.

<p>CAIN is a neighborhood ministry that transforms lives and inspires hope by providing nutritious food, crisis assistance, resources, and compassion in a way that respects human dignity and builds a more vibrant community.</p>

<p>CAIN was gifted with Grace Place, a beautiful home located in College Hill that has offered shelter to women and children in the Catholic Worker tradition for nearly two decades</p>

<p>The Interfaith Hospitality Network (IHN) of Greater Cincinnati provides homeless families emergency  shelter and hospitality through interfaith communities, and works with families to find and  retain stable housing.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2016, CAIN and IHN  began a collaborative effort in the use of Grace Place to provide shelter to women and children in transition from homelessness. In 2016, the partnership at Grace Place has touched the lives of our guest residents (41 moms and 93 children) and volunteers (312 volunteers from 25 Hosting Congregations).</p>



    
<p><STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
    <p>CAIN and IHNGC are seeking volunteer groups from congregations, schools, youth groups, service clubs, businesses and other organizations looking for opportunities to serve women and children experiencing homelessness. Volunteer groups will be providing meals (dinners, breakfasts, and lunches to pack), occasional evening activities, and an overnight volunteer, if possible.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful opportunity to work with others in the faith community offering hospitality to women and children in need. It can truly be a summer of grace for all involved.</p>

<p>Contact Hume Jamison at IHNGC at hume@ihncincinnati.org, or 513-471-1100, ext. 110, or contact MiMi Chamberlin at director@cainministry.org or 513-591-2246, ext. 3 to learn more or to help.</p>

<p>The Catholic Worker has been present in Akron for twenty years.  Presently we are in transition.</p>

<p>The last “founding member” is semi-retiring.  Meanwhile, as a community, we are seeking new members, especially persons who could live-in part or full time, with talents and energy for vision and direct service.  We are open and prayerfully discerning the best direction to follow.</p>
<p>Our core ministry is hospitality to women and children with a heavy emphasis on immigrants.  We currently provide housing and direct service.  We have and are in cooperation with other grassroots groups who are in service to the neighborhood.  We have consciously endeavored to be a “good neighbor” and are well integrated into the local community.  We strongly believe that Catholic Worker presence in Akron is and has been a blessing to all.  We are well supported by the larger community.</p>
<p>While we operate as an “organism” more so than an organization – we do have a strong organization.  We are open to the work of the Holy Spirit as we move forward.  Our greatest hope is that the principles of the Gospel as lived by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin be followed.</p>

<p>

    We are an intentional Christian community living in the former convent at St. James the Less Catholic Church in Columbus, with many community members also living off site. We are newly moved in as of January 2009. Our ministries are evolving but so far include the following: We pray regularly together as a community. We offer our 20-bedroom facility for retreats and workshops. We started offering fee meals to the community and regularly host a Hispanic legal clinic. Plans are underway for ESL classes, community garden, and hospitality for the homeless. Our community has been involved in activism against the death penalty. We share a building with a food pantry of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and are looking for ways to add more services such as hot meals, clothing distribution, free store, etc. We are eager to offer hospitality to traveling Catholic Workers and activists.

<p>

<p>

	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
    We are excited to welcome others as either full or part-time Workers, including those who want to live with us in community. We welcome your input in either developing new ministries or supporting the ones we currently have! Come talk to us!

    A little more than seven years ago, the Yankton Catholic Worker community opened the doors of Emmaus House. This ministry provides hospitality for women and children visiting loved ones at the state prisons in Springfield and Yankton, as well as the Human Services Center and the Yankton Federal Prison Camp.

<p>

    At the core of our ministry is the love of Christ: It is revealed in the community built amongst our guests. It is manifested by the practice of mutual aid and sharing between our guests. It is a gift for us to practice the Corporal Works of Mercy.

<p>We are a non-sectarian community, not based in prayer or religious doctrine, affiliated with the Catholic Worker movement through many years of personal association, and a deeply shared ethical and social vision. Our common purpose is to explore and demonstrate an ecologically sustainable way of life within a city, based on agricultural use of open land, and a simple common life to minimize our consumption of world resources. We also practice radical direct action for justice and peace, and use our houses and land for education about peacemaking and the nonviolent life we seek to develop.
</p>
<p>We own four houses in an inner city Nashville neighborhood, with about an acre of arable land and housing for a total of seventeen community members. Each household is semi-autonomous. We welcome visits and inquiries from people who might be interested in joining us, or investing in similar land and houses that are available at very reasonable cost, nearby in our neighborhood. We also welcome visits from travelers interested in our vision and work.</p>

    Is God calling you to assist in the gentle birth of a new Catholic Worker House? Is He calling you to grow food and help others form a new agronomic university? If so, please respond by praying for A Simple Life. This new Catholic worker house is 100 years old located in Bells, Texas on 3 acres.This ministry can presently support only one experienced worker resident who is good at begging or can hold a part-time job. The catholic Worker lifestyle is simple, practicing voluntary poverty, being obedient to conscience(God and gospel), and chaste in christian virtue.  The gentle birth of this house requires much labor and multi-tasking abilities of homemaking, gardening and carpentry/building skills.Living space will be evolving with growth. Volunteers are needed at every level and stage of growth.We are begging. Please send monetary gifts.

<p>

    Little Flower is a small CW homestead in rural VA, about a 1/2 hour east of Charlottesville. We grow food, and practice community, hospitality and resistance. We spend our days working--mostly manual labor, sometimes for pay; protesting war, building giant puppets, weeding the garden and responding to the needs of the moment. We welcome visitors, whether in need of shelter or looking to experiment with an alternative lifestyle of precarity, community and taking personal responsibility for addressing systemic violence. Send us an e-mail and we'll eventually check it on our slow dial-up, or call or write.

    <p>The <i>St. Francis Catholic Worker</i> is a one-page, home-spun newsletter, offered free of charge, mailed faithfully February, May, August, and November to all who request a copy.</p>

<p>Born in Washington, DC in 1979 as a hospitality house for single adults, both male and female, we missioned and helped to start the Dorothy Day Catholic Worker House for families. Several members of our community prayerfully became its core community in 1981. Experiencing a new call to service from Jesus we embraced a long held vision of a spiritual retreat center for folks living in shelters and transitional houses. Thus, in 1993 we moved to the above address and began hosting non-denominational, directed, group retreats (with the assistance of volunteer retreat directors). Our 12 bedroom retreat house and separate chapel with the Blessed Sacrament, located on a ten acre wooded property, is an oasis of love for our sisters and brothers who come.</p>



<p>Our community house, separate from the retreat house, has room for 5 people: 2 couples and a single person. Each bedroom has its own bathroom and quiet space. Simple living, in solidarity with the poor, requires much change from the average American lifestyle. Our wood burning fireplace gives winters warmth along with baseboard heat backup, used only as needed. Food bank shopping, limited use of community vehicle, Mass daily at our local parish are a few examples of our attempt at simple living. We are a mix of Martha and Mary: we meditate each day and we do laundry too.</p>

<p>

<p>

	<STRONG>Volunteers needed:</STRONG><BR>
    <p>For our ministry of hospitality and love coupled with a retreat ministry for the homeless who are longing for a stronger connection to Christ. We seek a couple and a single person approximately between ages 45 and 65 to join our faith community and work with our retreatants. We look for willing hearts to

make a long term commitment to engage in all aspects of life here -- from bookkeeping, letter writing, gardening, bed making, retreat direction and faith sharing with our guests, to community prayer and a little laughter.</p>



<p>We take seriously the command, "Come follow me" and because of that we live a faith fulfilled life.</p>

<p><b>HISTORICALLY SPEAKING</b></p>

<p>Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day often went on retreats, themselves. Dorothy wrote of her own retreat experiences and urged others to make retreats. "Food for the soul," she called them. Her writing clearly shows she envisioned Catholic Worker retreat houses --"... It is certainly a dream for the future." We are humbled to be part of the lying out of her dream.</p>





<p>Inquiries Welcome. Please contact John or Polly Mahoney, or Pumpkin, our cat, at the above address and phone.</p>

<p>PEACE -- PLEASE PRAY FOR US.</p>

Publication: <i>The Radish</i><br>

<p>

    The Radish House is committed to acts of resistance against oppression. We specifically engage with trans and queer communities and discern the ways in which all forms of oppression intersect and affect those who are most marginalized within our churches and our communities. As a new house, we are still in the process of discernment but recognize that in order to serve the communities we want to serve, we feel this whole process should be done in community. We also recognize that the philosophy and mission work of our house will be dynamic and ever-changing and we want to start now, getting feedback from the community as we go along hopefully allowing everyone to grow.
<p>
The house is currently full but if you are a Trans or Queer person or ally in need of temporary accommodation contact us. Please note that there are animals (cat and dog) in the house as well as children.</p>
<p><em>Consider contacting Radish House to help with childcare, community living and solidarity and helping with community meals.</em></p>

<p>Email: <A HREF="mailto:goneil327@gmail.com">goneil327@gmail.com</A></p>
<p>Website: <a href="http://www.stjohnsmission.org/" target="_blank">St John the Compassionate Orthodox Mission</a></p>

<p>St John the Compassionate Mission is an apostolate of the Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese. It is an Orthodox Christian community dedicated to serving the poor and the marginalized. It is founded on the example of St John the Merciful and the Fathers of the Church, especially St Basil the Great and St John Chrysostom. It has also been influenced by the more contemporary writings and the examples of Charles de Foucauld, Dorothy Day and Jean Vanier. </p>

<p>The community began as a small mission in a poor neighbourhood in Toronto over 30 years ago. Now we're a small group of clergy and lay folks plus an extended community, located on the east side of Toronto. The main building of the Mission has a beautiful chapel (where we worship). We also have a famous artisanal bakery (beside the main building), and a thrift store. Both the Bakery and the Thrift Store are run as social enterprises. We share with the Catholic Worker centres a concern and care for the poor. Unlike Catholic Worker houses we do not have regular accommodation for the homeless or casual visitors. </p>

<p>We have a house nearby the Mission for an intentional community for those who are interested in serving the poor and learning from the deep spirituality of the Orthodox Church. We welcome anyone to come and share in our life. You don't need to be Orthodox but you do need to be willing to participate fully in the life of this intentional community centred on the liturgical and prayer life of the Orthodox Church. We are especially looking for people who would like to come and stay longer term as community members for a minimum commitment of three months. Room and board can be provided. The members would be expected to participate fully in the life and ministries (programs) of the whole community. </p>

<p>Broadly speaking, our work involves running an early morning breakfast program for the homeless throughout the year, serving regular meals at the mission, running a small parish, various outreach programs, regular discussions and lectures, and all kinds of other ad hoc projects that develop. Recently, this has led us to the east of the city where the working poor live in great high-rise towers. We are renting an apartment on the first floor of the building and getting to know the residents of the towers. We have converted the apartment into a space where people can meet, share meals with one another, and pray.</p>

<p>We live a simple life on a remote farm in the northern parkland region of Manitoba.  We grow and freely share garden vegetables and haskap (both fruit and  licensed plants) with  individuals and CW houses who express nutritional  need.  We offer free hospitality to workers and retreatants on a limited scale.  Cleaning, dyeing, and weaving wool is a staple of our work during the winter.  As Benedictine Oblates we engage in daily liturgical prayer, contemplative prayer, and lectio divina using scripture and a variety of texts throughout our day.  We sponsor community discussions and studies on attributes and values related to the Works of Mercy, the Catholic Worker, and the social teachings of the church.  We value solitude and silence as well as community and discussion. We carry with us a very distinct, joyful sense of the seamlessness of Creation, of the comprehensiveness of our relationship to the physical world and its peoples, and of the roles of compassion, care, nurture, and mental health that are personally needed to die to ourselves, to serve others, and to act for restorative justice.  We welcome all people of good-will regardless of religion, creed, race, and orientations.</p>

<p>

    We are a newly established community in rural Mexico, founded by former LACW community members. Casa Colibri: We are an intentional community in the Catholic Worker tradition. Our projects include: a small organic farm; child, teen, and adult English classes; traditional folklorico dance classes; artistic and cultural workshops; round table discussions; prayer; and monthly in-house liturgies. In addition to our efforts to connect with and build community in the rural town of Hostotipaquillo, we are committed to maintaining our physical, emotional, and spiritual health. This we believe is essential to the Catholic Worker philosophy of "building a new society in the shell of the old."

<p>Nazareth House (Bahay Nazareth) is an ecumenical house of hospitality rooted in the spirit of the Catholic Worker Movement  founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933. We seek to embody the Gospel ideals of prayer, voluntary poverty and simplicity of life, and corporal and spiritual works of mercy, which include solidarity with the poor and the oppressed, non-violent peace and justice, radical hospitality, and life in community. Located in Manila, Philippines, our main apostolic ministry is to provide a home to persons living with HIV or AIDS who do not have adequate financial means for housing, and are unable to secure assistance from family or friends. We are LGBTQ friendly.</p>


<p><i>Consider contacting Nazareth House to volunteer your time or to participate in their community life.</i></p>
