	<H3>The Aims and Means of the Catholic Worker</H3>

	</CENTER>
	Reprinted from <i>The Catholic Worker</i> newspaper, May 2012
	<P>
	<B>The aim of the Catholic Worker movement is to live in accordance
	with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ. Our sources are the
	Hebrew and Greek Scriptures as handed down in the teachings of
	the Roman Catholic Church, with our inspiration coming from the
	lives of the saints, &quot;men and women outstanding in holiness,
	living witnesses to Your unchanging love.&quot; (Eucharistic Prayer)</B>
	<P>
	This aim requires us to begin living in a different way. We recall
	the words of our founders, Dorothy Day who said, &quot;God meant
	things to be much easier than we have made them,&quot; and Peter
	Maurin who wanted to build a society &quot;where it is easier
	for people to be good.&quot;
	<P>
	<center> * * *</center>
	<P>
	When we examine our society, which is generally called capitalist
	(because of its methods of producing and controlling wealth) and
	is bourgeois (because of prevailing concern for acquisition and
	material interests, and its emphasis on respectability and mediocrity),
	we find it far from God's justice.
	<P>
	--<B>In economics, </B>private and state capitalism bring about
	an unjust distribution of wealth, for the profit motive guides
	decisions. Those in power live off the sweat of others' brows,
	while those without power are robbed of a just return for their
	work. Usury (the charging of interest above administrative costs)
	is a major contributor to the wrongdoing intrinsic to this system.
	We note, especially, how the world debt crisis leads poor countries
	into greater deprivation and a dependency from which there is
	no foreseeable escape. Here at home, the number of hungry and
	homeless and unemployed people rises in the midst of increasing
	affluence.
	<P>
	--<B>In labor, </B>human need is no longer the reason for human
	work. Instead, the unbridled expansion of technology, necessary
	to capitalism and viewed as &quot;progress,&quot; holds sway.
	Jobs are concentrated in productivity and administration for a
	&quot;high-tech,&quot; war-related, consumer society of disposable
	goods, so that laborers are trapped in work that does not contribute
	to human welfare. Furthermore, as jobs become more specialized,
	many people are excluded from meaningful work or are alienated
	from the products of their labor. Even in farming, agribusiness
	has replaced agriculture, and, in all areas, moral restraints
	are run over roughshod, and a disregard for the laws of nature
	now threatens the very planet.
	<P>
	--<B>In politics, </B>the state functions to control and regulate
	life. Its power has burgeoned hand in hand with growth in technology,
	so that military, scientific and corporate interests get the highest
	priority when concrete political policies are formulated. Because
	of the sheer size of institutions, we tend towards government
	by bureaucracy--that is, government by nobody. Bureaucracy, in all
	areas of life, is not only impersonal, but also makes accountability,
	and, therefore, an effective political forum for redressing grievances,
	next to impossible.
	<P>
	--<B>In morals, </B>relations between people are corrupted by distorted
	images of the human person. Class, race and gender often determine
	personal worth and position within society, leading to structures
	that foster oppression. Capitalism further divides society by
	pitting owners against workers in perpetual conflict over wealth
	and its control. Those who do not &quot;produce&quot; are abandoned,
	and left, at best, to be &quot;processed&quot; through institutions.
	Spiritual destitution is rampant, manifested in isolation, madness,
	promiscuity and violence.
	<P>
	--<B>The arms race </B> stands as a clear sign of the direction
	and spirit of our age. It has extended the domain of destruction
	and the fear of annihilation, and denies the basic right to
	life. There is a direct connection between the arms race and
	destitution. &quot;The arms race is an utterly treacherous trap,
	and one which injures the poor to an intolerable degree.&quot;
	(Vatican II)
	<P>

	<P>
	In contrast to what we see around us, as well as within ourselves,
	stands St. Thomas Aquinas' doctrine of the Common Good, a vision
	of a society where the good of each member is bound to the good
	of the whole in the service of God.
	<P>
	To this end, we advocate:
	<P>
	--<B>Personalism, </B>a philosophy which regards the freedom and
	dignity of each person as the basis, focus and goal of all metaphysics
	and morals. In following such wisdom, we move away from a self-centered
	individualism toward the good of the other. This is to be done
	by taking personal responsibility for changing conditions, rather
	than looking to the state or other institutions to provide impersonal
	&quot;charity.&quot; We pray for a Church renewed by this philosophy
	and for a time when all those who feel excluded from participation
	are welcomed with love, drawn by the gentle personalism Peter
	Maurin taught.
	<P>
	--A <B>decentralized society, </B>in contrast to the present bigness
	of government, industry, education, health care and agriculture.
	We encourage efforts such as family farms, rural and urban land
	trusts, worker ownership and management of small factories, homesteading
	projects, food, housing and other cooperatives--any effort in which
	money can once more become merely a medium of exchange, and human
	beings are no longer commodities.
	<P>
	--A <B>&quot;green revolution,&quot; </B>so that it is possible
	to rediscover the proper meaning of our labor and our true bonds
	with the land; a distributist communitarianism, self-sufficient
	through farming, crafting and appropriate technology; a radically
	new society where people will rely on the fruits of their own
	toil and labor; associations of mutuality, and a sense of fairness
	to resolve conflicts. 
	<P><center>* * *</center><p>
	We believe this needed personal and social transformation should
	be pursued by the means Jesus revealed in His sacrificial love.
	With Christ as our Exemplar, by prayer and communion with His
	Body and Blood, we strive for practices of:
	<P>
	--<B>Nonviolence</B>. &quot;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
	shall be called children of God.&quot; (Matt. 5:9) Only through
	nonviolent action can a personalist revolution come about, one
	in which one evil will not simply be replaced by another. Thus,
	we oppose the deliberate taking of human life for any reason,
	and see every oppression as blasphemy. Jesus taught us to take
	suffering upon ourselves rather than inflict it upon others, and
	He calls us to fight against violence with the spiritual weapons
	of prayer, fasting and noncooperation with evil. Refusal to pay
	taxes for war, to register for conscription, to comply with any
	unjust legislation; participation in nonviolent strikes and boycotts,
	protests or vigils; withdrawal of support for dominant systems,
	corporate funding or usurious practices are all excellent means
	to establish peace.
	<P>
	--<B>The works of mercy </B> (as found in Matt. 25:31-46) are at
	the heart of the Gospel and they are clear mandates for our response
	to &quot;the least of our brothers and sisters.&quot; Houses of
	hospitality are centers for learning to do the acts of love, so
	that the poor can receive what is, in justice, theirs, the second
	coat in our closet, the spare room in our home, a place at our
	table. Anything beyond what we immediately need belongs to those
	who go without.
	<P>
	--<B>Manual labor, </B>in a society that rejects it as undignified
	and inferior. &quot;Besides inducing cooperation, besides overcoming
	barriers and establishing the spirit of sister and brotherhood
	(besides just getting things done), manual labor enables us to
	use our bodies as well as our hands, our minds.&quot; (Dorothy
	Day) The Benedictine motto <I>Ora et Labora </I>reminds us that
	the work of human hands is a gift for the edification of the world
	and the glory of God.
	<P>
	--<B>Voluntary poverty. </B>"The mystery of poverty is that by sharing
	in it, making ourselves poor in giving to others, we increase
	our knowledge and belief in love.&quot; (Dorothy Day) By embracing
	voluntary poverty, that is, by casting our lot freely with those
	whose impoverishment is not a choice, we would ask for the grace
	to abandon ourselves to the love of God. It would put us on the
	path to incarnate the Church's &quot;preferential option for the
	poor.&quot;
	<P>
	<center>* * *</center>
	<P>
	<B>We must be prepared to accept seeming failure with these aims,
	for sacrifice and suffering are part of the Christian life. Success,
	as the world determines it, is not the final criterion for judgments.
	The most important thing is the love of Jesus Christ  and how
	to live His truth. </B>
