	<H3>Dorothy Day: Lecture on Centenary</H3>
	<B>By<BR> Robert Ellsberg</B>

	</CENTER>
	<P>	Lecture given at the New York University Symposium honoring Dorothy Day's centenary on November 8, 1997. Used with permission.</p>
	
	<HR>

	<p>
	Dorothy Day has been called many things.
	<P>
	After her death in 1980 the historian David O'Brien called her "the most important, interesting, and influential figure in the history of American Catholicism."<P>
	On the other hand she liked to tell a story about how she once paid a visit to a family. Upon being introduced to their young child the boy burst into tears. When asked why he was crying she confessed, "All day long they've been saying `Dorothy Day is coming, Dorothy Day is coming.' And now you're here and you're just an old woman."<P>
	Some people called her a communist. This didn't especially bother her. I recall how amused she was to hear these words from J. Edgar Hoover which I discovered in her declassified FBI file:<P>
	"Dorothy Day is a very erratic and irresponsible person. She has engaged in activities which strongly suggest that she is consciously or unconsciously being used by communist groups. From past experience with her it is obvious she maintains a very hostile and belligerent attitude toward the Bureau and makes every effort to castigate the FBI whenever she feels so inclined."<P>
	And then there were those, quite numerous, who called her a saint. This was another matter. "Don't call me a saint," she used to say: "I don't want to be dismissed so easily."<P> She was all too conscious that when we call people "saints" we tend to put them on a pedestal, as if their witness belonged to some rarefied atmosphere too thin for ordinary mortals.  "Dorothy can do such things; she's a saint!"<P>
	Dorothy had given this quite a lot of thought. "When they call you a saint," she said, "it means basically that you are not to be taken seriously." <P> Of course this attitude contrasted with her own enormous veneration for the saints. Her daily speech and her writings were filled with references to such figures as St. Paul,  Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Teresa of Avila, and of course her beloved St. Therese of Lisieux. She even wrote a book about Therese and her spirituality of the "Little Way." It was Therese who indicated the path to holiness that lies in the duties and sacrifices of everyday life, and Dorothy was delighted that the church, responding to popular acclamation, had processed the canonization of St. Therese with unusual
	speed. There is no doubt that she would have welcomed the
	news, last month, that St. Therese has been declared a Doctor
	of the Church.<P>

	For Dorothy the saints were not idealized superhumans. They
	were her constant companions and daily guides in the imitation
	of Christ. She relished the human details of their struggles to
	be faithful, realizing full well that in their own time the saints
	were often regarded as eccentrics and troublemakers. She filled
	the pages of The Catholic Worker with illustrations by Ade
	Bethune and Fritz Eichenberg that displayed the saints as
	companions of everyday life--at least for those whose
	everyday life includes work and prayer and service to the poor.
	<P>
	"We are all called to be saints," she wrote, ". . . and we might
	as well get over our bourgeois fear of the name. We might also
	get used to recognizing the fact that there is some of the saint
	in all of us. Inasmuch as we are growing, putting off the old
	man and putting on Christ, there is some of the saint, the holy,
	the divine right there."
	<P>
	In other words Dorothy saw the task of being a Christian as a
	process of sanctification, a process of being conformed to the
	pattern of Christ. It was a process that was never completed,
	because there was always more to be accomplished. But I
	think there can be no doubt that in Dorothy Day there was
	more than simply "some of the saint." How much? That is
	what I wish to discuss today.
	<P>
	Some years ago Cardinal O'Connor wrote in Catholic New
	York: "Shortly after I announced the study of Cardinal Cooke's
	life, several people wrote to ask me: `Why not Dorothy Day?' .
	. . It's a good question. Indeed, it's an excellent question. [It's
	almost impossible to read By Little and By Little: The
	Selected Writings of Dorothy Day, without asking it,
	especially if she started you thinking more than forty 
	years ago.] . . . I would be interested in your answers."
	<P>
	What follows is my own answer to that question.
	<P>
	In 1983 the Claretians announced that they would take on the
	initial work of promoting the cause of Dorothy's canonization.
	Ironically, this provoked much criticism by some who had
	been closest to Dorothy, including members of her family as
	well as the Catholic Worker. It is not uncommon to question
	the worthiness of a candidate for canonization. But in this case
	the question was just the opposite. With Dorothy Day, as Ken
	Woodward has noted, there was "suspicion that the process is
	unworthy of the candidate."
	<P>
	Many in the Catholic Worker expressed indifference or even
	hostility to the idea of canonizing Dorothy Day, feeling it
	would represent a cooptation of her witness. It would shift
	attention from imitation to veneration, a preoccupation with
	miracles, and so forth. It would cost money that could be spent
	on the poor. It would put too much emphasis on one person
	rather than the community she was part of. Inevitably church
	officials would try to emphasize her "wonderful work" with
	the poor, her orthodox piety, her spirit of obedience and
	respect for the magisterium, and so would filter out the
	problematic areas of her life and witness--particularly her
	radical pacifism and her resistance to the state.
	<P>
	Of course to name someone a saint does not make not the
	slightest difference to the saint herself. It is not like winning
	the Academy Award or being added to the Hall of Fame.
	Canonization is not intended to benefit or honor the saint. It is
	intended to benefit the church. Dorothy herself understood
	this. When a saint is canonized it represents the church's
	solemn declaration that the life of this servant of God, her
	message and witness, provides a true and
	reliable guidepost for us on the path of Christian discipleship
	--which is to say, on our own path to holiness. The life of the
	church is enormously enriched each time a new saint is
	proposed for our imitation and veneration.
	<P>
	But, as Simone Weil suggested, "Today it is not nearly enough
	merely to be a saint; but we must have the saintliness
	demanded by the present moment."
	<P>
	If we are to regard Dorothy Day as a saint, we need to consider
	the particular gifts that she offers to the church and the world
	of our day.
	<P>
	Dorothy herself was aware of the need for a new type of saint.
	Describing her youthful thoughts on this subject she wrote,
	<P>
	"Whatever I had read as a child about the saints had
	thrilled me. I could see the nobility of giving one's life for the
	sick, the maimed, the leper. Priests and Sisters the world over
	could be working for the littlest ones of Christ, and my heart
	stirred at their work. But there was another question in my
	mind. Why was so much done in remedying the evil instead of
	avoiding it in the first place? . . . Where were the saints to try
	to change the social, not just to minister to the slaves, but to do
	away with slavery?"
	<P>
	In effect, Dorothy's vocation took form around this challenge.
	And I would cite this as her first great gift to the church. It was
	her vocation to join charity with justice. It was in search of this
	vocation that she prayed at the Shrine of the Immaculate
	Conception in 1932 that "some way would open up for me to
	use what talents I possessed for my fellow workers, for the
	poor." She longed, as she put it, "to make a synthesis
	reconciling body and soul, this world and the next. . ."
	<P>
	Dorothy devoted her life to the works of mercy: feeding the
	hungry, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless. And it is
	ironic to note that had she confined herself to this her cause of
	sanctification would be more assured. But she went further.
	She set herself "against a social order which made so much
	charity in the present sense of the word necessary." In other
	words, she combined the practice of charity with the struggle
	for justice. This has always caused controversy. As Dom
	Helder Camara once said: "When I give food to the hungry
	they call me a saint; when I ask why the poor are hungry they
	call me a communist."
	<P>
	It is this conjunction of charity and justice that made many
	people uncomfortable with Dorothy in her lifetime, as today it
	makes some uncomfortable with calling her a saint. But I
	believe that on this path she created a new model of
	discipleship, a new model of holiness, a new way of being a
	saint that combines what Peguy called the mystical and the
	political. Dorothy did more than anyone to win credibility for
	this path. In so doing she represented an aspect of the
	saintliness demanded by the present moment.
	<P>
	The second great gift of Dorothy Day to the church was
	undoubtedly her commitment to the ideal of Gospel 
	nonviolence. This ideal was widely recognized in the early
	church. But after the conversion of Constantine it was
	effectively effaced by just war teaching. For years, in season
	and out, Dorothy was a solitary prophet insisting on the literal
	meaning of Jesus' words, "Love your enemies. Do good to
	them that persecute you."
	<P>
	Dorothy believed that Jesus had come to offer a radical new
	definition of love as the ultimate law of our lives. "A new
	commandment I give you, that you love one another as I have
	loved you." It was a new commandment, for the love
	exemplified on the cross extended beyond friends and those on
	our side. Jesus had left us a definition of nonviolence, not only
	in his words, but in the manner of his life. By his death and
	resurrection he had converted the cross, a sign of defeat, into a
	symbol of life and hope. And he had come to substitute the
	cross for the sword or the bomb as an effective instrument of
	liberation and justice.
	<P>
	By maintaining this witness through one war after another
	Dorothy challenged and enlarged the conscience of the church.
	Because of her the Church has been challenged to assume a
	more prophetic role in the vindication of life, and the word
	Christian has grown that much closer to recovering its original
	signification of Peacemaker. For this gift, Dorothy Day should
	be canonized.
	<P>
	The list of saints is notoriously weak on presenting models of
	holiness among the laity. This points to a third great gift of
	Dorothy Day. Here was a lay woman--long before such things
	were heard of--who assumed the leadership of a lay apostolic
	movement of men and women. At the time when she and Peter
	Maurin established the Catholic Worker, it was assumed that
	such a Catholic movement must inevitably be authorized or
	directed by the hierarchy. Dorothy operated out of a different
	model of the church. She sought no permission before living
	out the radical implications of her faith. She held no office in
	the church. And yet she came to claim an authority that owed
	nothing to institutional power or official status. It was simply
	rooted in her courage, integrity and faithfulness to the gospel.
	<P>
	Another point deserves emphasis here. When the church does
	occasionally canonize lay people, these are often men or
	women who, in their life experience and spirituality, were
	virtually indistinguishable from monks or nuns. In Dorothy
	Day we have a saint who truly experienced the joys and 
	sorrows of family life, of motherhood, and life in a somewhat
	raucous and mixed community. This is a saint whose
	conversion was prompted by the experience of pregnancy and
	the joy of love.
	<P>
	She wrote,
	<P>
	"I had known enough of love to know that a good
	healthy family life was as near to heaven as one could get in
	this life. There was another sample of heaven, of the
	enjoyment of God. The very sexual act itself was used again
	and again in Scripture as a figure of the beatific vision. It was
	not because I was tired of sex, satiated, disillusioned, that I
	turned to God. Radical friends used to insinuate this. It was
	because through a whole love, both physical and spiritual, I
	came to know God."
	<P>
	It was her happiness and joy and delight in the created world
	that awakened in her heart "a flood of gratitude." "The final
	object of this love and gratitude was God. No human creature
	could receive or contain so vast a flood of love and joy as I
	often felt after the birth of my child. With this came the need
	to worship, to adore."
	<P>
	Although her conversion ultimately required that she part from
	the father of her child this was not because she disdained
	married life, but because she felt such a strong commitment to
	the sacramental meaning of marriage. Here too is where she
	forged her "synthesis of body and soul, this world and the
	next." For Dorothy all things in nature were the potential
	channels of grace. This strong sacramental instinct was rooted,
	ultimately, in the central mystery of Christianity, the doctrine
	of the Incarnation. Dorothy's distinctive spirituality was based
	on the radical implications of this doctrine. In her development
	of these implications lay yet another of her essential gifts to
	the church.
	<P>
	As Dorothy saw it, God had entered our flesh and our history,
	and had left the imprint of divinity all around us. All life was
	hallowed. God was present in our neighbors, especially in the
	disguise of those in need. It was Dorothy more than anyone of
	our time, who rediscovered the plain challenge of Jesus' words,
	"Inasmuch as you did this for the least of my brothers and
	sisters you did it for me."
	<P>
	We didn't have to worry about what we would have done for 
	Christ if we had lived 2000 years ago. Whatever we should
	have done then we could do now. That Christ was to be found
	in our neighbor was not just an article of faith. This was her
	experience. If bread and wine, the work of human hands, could
	become the body of Christ, what else might we discover in the
	world around us, if we had eyes to see properly?
	<P>
	She believed in the real presence of Christ in the consecrated
	bread and wine on the altar. But she believed that Christ was
	also truly present in the poor. And so our response to the poor
	was a test of the authenticity of our worship. How could we
	love God whom we haven't seen if we haven't loved our
	neighbor whom we have seen? And how could we love our
	neighbors who are hungry except by feeding them? "The
	mystery of the poor is this: that they are Jesus and what you do
	for them you do to him."
	<P>
	For all these gifts and for all she taught us with her words and
	deeds I believe that Dorothy Day is an authentic saint who
	speaks to the demands of our time. Ironically, this is now more
	the case than in her own lifetime. Throughout much of her life
	Dorothy was regarded as a venerable but controversial figure
	somewhere on the margins of the Catholic church. That is
	no longer so. Now at a time when the American church is itself
	so widely polarized between contending camps, Dorothy Day
	may be the true saint for what Cardinal Bernardin called "the
	common ground."
	<P>
	Her strong emphasis on the primacy of conscience, her
	courage in resisting war and injustice, and her solidarity with
	the oppressed, made her a beloved figure to the left. But these
	positions were combined with pious adherence to Catholic
	moral teaching and a strong respect for the magisterium. The
	fact is that Dorothy was much closer in her outlook to the
	humanism of Pope John Paul II than many of her reform-
	minded admirers would care to admit. Yet she was much too
	open in her appreciation of the world, she was much too
	catholic in her tastes, to believe that everything good and true
	and beautiful was included in the church. There was, after all,
	Dostovesky and Dickens and the novels of Chaim Potok, not
	to mention the opera, Sacco and Vanzetti, her communist
	friends, and the ailanthus tree outside her window.
	<P>
	Above all she insisted that the church be held accountable to
	its ideals and founding mission. "I loved the Church for Christ
	made visible. Not for itself, because it was so often a scandal
	to me. Romano Guardini said the Church is the Cross on
	which Christ was crucified; one could not separate Christ from
	His Cross, and one must live in a state of permanent
	dissatisfaction with the Church."
	<P>
	Dorothy, in short, is not easily claimed by either liberals or
	conservatives. Ultimately she represented something more
	radical. And she reminded us that we too are called to
	something much more radical than our identity as champions
	of tradition or partisans of reform. Ultimately we are called to
	be saints.
	<P>
	Dorothy answered that call. Thinking of her today, seventeen
	years after her death, I am reminded of her words about Peter
	Maurin, words that could apply as well to herself. She noted
	that some people criticized Peter for being "holier than thou."
	Well, Peter was holy, she said. Holier than anyone we ever
	knew.
	<P>
	We are not called to be another St. Francis or St. Teresa or St.
	Dorothy, but the particular saint that God wants us to be. And
	if we are moved to call Dorothy a saint it should not be with
	the motive of putting her on pedestal but as an inspiration to
	respond more faithfully to our calling.
	<P>
	Dorothy was a great believer in what de Caussade called "the
	sacrament of the present moment." In each situation, in each
	encounter, in each task before us there was a path to God. We
	didn't need to be in a monastery or a chapel. We didn't need to
	be become different people first. We could start today, this
	moment, where we are, to add to the balance of love in the
	world.
	<P>
	As Cardinal Newman said: "The tragedy is never to have
	begun." Dorothy Day made more than a beginning. And so we
	honor her on the centenary of her birth. We honor her best by
	making our own beginnings.
