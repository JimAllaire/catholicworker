We can accommodate up to three more live-in volunteers and would love to explore that possibility with you! All people are welcome, and we are particularly interested in hearing from people of color and people with experience in the mental health field (Duluth is facing a severe shortage of mental health providers, which is evident in our daily work). </p>

		<p>We live between four nearby houses in a quiet residential neighborhood just east of downtown Duluth. We welcome people of all faiths and are LGBTI- and family-friendly. We strive to balance our workload so members can pursue part-time work or school in addition to their daily commitments to the community. Decisions are made collectively and we actively study nonviolent communication to improve the quality of our relationships with each other. Room and board is covered and long-term members tithe 10% of their income back to the community. There is no stipend and we do not provide health insurance, but Minnesota has generous public plans. We ask potential new members to join us for a 3-month trial period before making a commitment.</p>

		<p>Duluth has a thriving arts culture and tends blue-collar Left in politics. We are close to nature and blocks away from Lake Superior. That said, it does get really cold in the winter (but green and gorgeous in the summer!).</P>

		<P>Is God calling you to assist in the gentle birth of a new Catholic Worker House? Is He calling you to grow food and help others form a new agronomic university? If so, please respond by praying for A Simple Life. This new Catholic worker house is 100 years old located in Bells, Texas on 3 acres.This ministry can presently support only one experienced worker resident who is good at begging or can hold a part-time job. The catholic Worker lifestyle is simple, practicing voluntary poverty, being obedient to conscience(God and gospel), and chaste in christian virtue.  The gentle birth of this house requires much labor and multi-tasking abilities of homemaking, gardening and carpentry/building skills.Living space will be evolving with growth. Volunteers are needed at every level and stage of growth.We are begging. Please send monetary gifts. </p>

	<h4>St Francis Catholic Worker - Spotsylvania (

	    </h4>
		<P><p>For our ministry of hospitality and love coupled with a retreat ministry for the homeless who are longing for a stronger connection to Christ. We seek a couple and a single person approximately between ages 45 and 65 to join our faith community and work with our retreatants. We look for willing hearts to

	make a long term commitment to engage in all aspects of life here -- from bookkeeping, letter writing, gardening, bed making, retreat direction and faith sharing with our guests, to community prayer and a little laughter.</p>



	<p>We take seriously the command, "Come follow me" and because of that we live a faith fulfilled life.</p>

	<p><b>HISTORICALLY SPEAKING</b></p>

	<p>Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day often went on retreats, themselves. Dorothy wrote of her own retreat experiences and urged others to make retreats. "Food for the soul," she called them. Her writing clearly shows she envisioned Catholic Worker retreat houses --"... It is certainly a dream for the future." We are humbled to be part of the lying out of her dream.</p>





	<p>Inquiries Welcome. Please contact John or Polly Mahoney, or Pumpkin, our cat, at the above address and phone.</p>

	<p>PEACE -- PLEASE PRAY FOR US.</p>
