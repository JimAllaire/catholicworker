			<center><p><b> NASHVILLE GREENLANDS<br>
			Resident Volunteer Opportunities  - Long Term</p></center>

			<p> One opening, beginning mid-August 2018, and occasional openings as current residents move out to other commitments and housing.</b></p>

			<p>Nashville Greenlands is an intentional residential community devoted to urban agriculture and social justice action. We have a network of seven houses we have restored in a poor neighborhood in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
			<p>For the resident volunteer opportunities above, we are looking for people with a convincing commitment to a simple, just, and environmentally sensitive way of life, and to advocacy and activism for social justice and world peace.</p>
			<p>Our community structure is decentralized and non-directive. Housing and utilities are provided free in exchange for thirty hours per month of help with gardening and housing maintenance, under the guidance of the household coordinator. Beyond this commitment, residents choose their own areas of action and employment. Current residents are key organizers and activists in other community organizations devoted to outreach and service to homeless people, labor organizing and support among exploited immigrant workers, collection and distribution of surplus food to communities in need, criminal justice reform, environmental conservation, and world peace advocacy.</p>


		<p><b>CONTACT AND APPLICATION:</B> To discuss in more detail, call Karl Meyer at 615-322-9523, or to apply, send a personal statement of your interests and motivation, and a resume' of relevant background to Nashville Greenlands, 2407 Heiman St., Nashville, TN 372018-2415.

	<h4>St Francis Catholic Worker - Spotsylvania (

			VA)

	    </h4>
		<P><p>For our ministry of hospitality and love coupled with a retreat ministry for the homeless who are longing for a stronger connection to Christ. We seek a couple and a single person approximately between ages 45 and 65 to join our faith community and work with our retreatants. We look for willing hearts to

	make a long term commitment to engage in all aspects of life here -- from bookkeeping, letter writing, gardening, bed making, retreat direction and faith sharing with our guests, to community prayer and a little laughter.</p>



	<p>We take seriously the command, "Come follow me" and because of that we live a faith fulfilled life.</p>

	<p><b>HISTORICALLY SPEAKING</b></p>

	<p>Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day often went on retreats, themselves. Dorothy wrote of her own retreat experiences and urged others to make retreats. "Food for the soul," she called them. Her writing clearly shows she envisioned Catholic Worker retreat houses --"... It is certainly a dream for the future." We are humbled to be part of the lying out of her dream.</p>





	<p>Inquiries Welcome. Please contact John or Polly Mahoney, or Pumpkin, our cat, at the above address and phone.</p>

	<p>PEACE -- PLEASE PRAY FOR US.</p>
