		<H3>A Brief Introduction to the Catholic Worker Movement</H3>


		<B>By<BR> Tom Cornell </B>

		<BR>


		</CENTER>
		<P>
		<B>The Catholic Worker movement</B> is made up of people motivated by
		the teachings of Jesus, especially as they are summarized in the
		Sermon on the Mount, and the teachings of the Catholic Church,
		in the writings of the early Fathers and the social encyclicals
		of the modern popes, to bring about a &quot;new society within
		the shell of the old, a society in which it will be easier to
		be good.&quot; A society in tune with these teachings would have
		no place for economic exploitation or war, for racial, gender
		or religious discrimination, but would be marked by a cooperative
		social order without extremes of wealth and poverty and a nonviolent
		approach to legitimate defense and conflict resolution.
		<P>
		The movement publishes a tabloid-size organ seven times a year,
		<I>The Catholic Worker</I>. Started by an itinerant French worker-scholar
		(and illegal immigrant) Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day, a veteran
		left-wing journalist and Catholic convert, the paper was first
		sold in New York City, at a Communist Party May Day rally in Union
		Square, for a penny a copy, in 1933. The price remains the same.
		<H3>Peter Maurin</H3>

		<P>
		Peter Maurin saw the need for a new intellectual synthesis to
		meet the material and spiritual crisis epitomized by the great
		Depression and lasting to this day, a synthesis grounded in cult,
		that is prayer, in culture, that is literature and the arts, and
		agriculture, that is labor and the crafts. Houses of hospitality
		in the cities would make possible direct personal response to
		the needs of the wounded members of the larger community through
		direct practice of the corporal and spiritual works of mercy.
		Farming communes on the land would encourage scholars to become
		workers and workers to become scholars while obviating unemployment
		and forming &quot;cells of good living&quot; as a practical alternative
		to a moribund society. In city houses and farming communes regular
		meetings &quot;for the clarification of thought&quot; would be
		held. People of all persuasions would dialogue, to explore the
		causes for the present disorder and to find a way from where we
		are to where we ought to be.
		<P>
		Peter Maurin was a man of the soil, with deep roots. His family
		had worked the same land, in southern France, the Languedoc, for
		fifteen hundred years. His region had been evangelized by Irenaeus,
		disciple of Polycarp, disciple of John. Peter had worked with
		Le Sillion, a Catholic lay movement in France for political and
		social democracy. He worked as a laborer and as a teacher before
		emigrating to Canada as a prospector. He entered the US looking
		for work, prospered as a private teacher of French, returned to
		casual manual labor in order to study at his own pace a curriculum
		of his own design.
		<H3>Dorothy Day</H3>

		<P>
		Dorothy Day was a city woman, a Bohemian as well as a pioneer
		in the &quot;engaged journalism&quot; of the Left. She was born
		in New York City, grew up there and in Oakland, California, and
		Chicago before returning as a young adult to New York and a staff
		assignment at the daily Socialist <I>Call</I>. She worked on <I>The
		Liberator</I> staff and was acting editor of <I>The Masses</I>
		when it was closed by order of Attorney General Palmer during
		the Red Scare after World War I. Dorothy was jailed for picketing
		President Wilson's White House for the women's vote and participated
		in a hunger strike at Occoquan Prison. Her friends and fellow
		workers were socialists, anarchists and communists. She was an
		intimate as well of the literary circles in New York hat centered
		around Eugene O'Neil, Kenneth Burke and Malcolm Cowley. It was
		a heady time to be young and in New York.
		<P>
		And there was love. Dorothy's love, an Anglo-American named Forster,
		loved nature more than human society, introduced Dorothy to nature's
		beauty and gave her a daughter. In thanksgiving, and in hope of
		shielding her child from the moral confusion and pain of a rootless,
		secularized society, Dorothy yielded to an insistent and growing
		pull from the Transcendent, had he baby baptized and followed
		her into the Catholic Church.
		<H3>A Movement Begins</H3>

		<P>
		Peter had an idea. Dorothy had passion and ability and an unfulfilled
		desire to work, as she had with the radicals of the Left, for
		social justice, but now as a Christian and a Catholic. Out of
		their meeting in 1932, the Catholic Worker was born and the paper
		first offered to the public five months later. Some early visitors
		to the Catholic Worker headquarters noted its similarity in style
		and tone to <I>L'Esprit,</I> the lay Catholic intellectual journal
		in Paris at that time, identified with Emmanuel Mounier, Charles
		Peguy and Jacques Maritain. Maritain actively encouraged the work.
		<P>
		The circulation of the paper quickly reached 150,000, to plummet
		drastically during the Spanish Civil War and World War II, when
		the editorial position of the paper remained consistently Christian
		pacifist, and many volunteers and staff members went to prison
		or public service camps for refusing the draft. Post war recovery
		was slow but steady, and the movement distinguished itself for
		resisting Cold War hysteria and red-baiting. The movement took
		a leading role in stimulating opposition to the Viet Nam War.
		Early in its history the movement had organized to oppose anti-Semitism
		and has stood steadily for racial justice.
		<P>
		Over the years independent Catholic Worker house of hospitality
		and farming communes have sprung up, now numbering over one hundred,
		some with their own publications. In New York hundreds are fed
		on a &quot;no questions asked&quot; basis at the soup kitchen,
		scores of men, women and volunteers make their home in two houses
		in the Bowery and a farming commune upstate. Regular Friday Night
		Meetings for the Clarification of Thought are held and the paper's
		circulation has climbed to 90,000.
		<P>
		Anyone may seek help at the Catholic Worker. Anyone may volunteer
		who has the ability to take personal responsibility and work respectfully
		with others. Most of the volunteers are Catholics committed to
		active nonviolence. There is no means test and no religious test.
		<H3>Contemporary Issues</H3>

		<P>
		The nuclear age has sharpened awareness of the need for disarmament
		and alternatives to war. The widening gap between rich and poor
		in our country and between nations has spurred greater urgency
		in the quest for a more just social order. But the distinguishing
		marks of the movement remain smallness, decentralization, personal
		responsibility, the personal response to persons in need in direct
		encounter and a search for answers to the questions that arise
		from that meeting: Why are there so many poor and abandoned? What
		is honest work? What is due workers and the unemployed? What is
		the relationship between political, social and economic democracy,
		and between these and the common good? Just where are we, where
		do we want to be and how can we get there? What of means and end?
		What does it mean to follow Jesus Christ today?
		<P>
		Catholic Workers attempt to alleviate the sufferings of the poor
		by adopting lives of voluntary poverty in order to be free for
		direct, personal involvement, not so much dispensing charity as
		sharing in the lives of others. Voluntary poverty also frees us
		to respond to militarism, exploitation and racism in the spirit
		of Christian nonviolence, with the weapons of the Spirit, prayer,
		penance and self-sacrifice, and the weapons forged by Gandhi,
		Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez, and by the nonviolent activists
		with whom we work in the peace movement. We do not underestimate
		the task, noting that a generation after the passage of civil
		rights legislation large sectors of our minority populations are
		more depressed and isolated than ever. This struggle brings heartbreak,
		but it is fun, too, joy.
		<H3>Catholic Worker Legacy</H3>

		<P>
		From the Catholic Worker movement have sprung many off-shoots,
		among them the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists, the Catholic
		Peace Fellowship and Pax Christi, USA. Catholic Worker alumni
		can be found on the editorial staffs of major publications, on
		university faculties, in labor unions and in monasteries, and
		occasionally in jails and prisons for acts of nonviolent civil
		disobedience.
		<P>
		It is impossible to estimate the effect the movement has had on
		the Church or on society in an increasingly conservative environment.
		By its very existence for over sixty years the Catholic Worker
		has had something of a reproach to both, but its fidelity to a
		consistent life ethic, to the prophetic tradition of Israel, and
		to the &quot;gently personalism of traditional Christianity.&quot;
		Dorothy Day once wrote that &quot;What we do is very little, but
		its like the little boy with a few loaves and fishes. Christ took
		that little and increased it. He will do the rest.&quot;
