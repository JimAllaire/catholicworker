         <p>The Story of a Civil War Veteran Who Starved to Death and of His Widow, Who is Starving, Told Over Leaden Cheese Cake</p>
         <p><em>New York Call</em> November 16, 1916 Page 1</p>
         <p>The woman in the gingham apron that looked as though she had mopped her face with it said glumly:</p>
         <p>&#8220;Flour that used to cost only $3 a barrel has now went up to $9 and $11. So what do yuh expect a roll will be like when yu have to dope up the flour? That cheese cake there, that you don&#8217;t seem to be enjoying much, I used to get three cents for an now I ask five. The people won&#8217;t buy off you if you raise things a cent on them, so there they stay in the window and get soggy. I don&#8217;t make any money on them, even if I do have to raise the price.&#8221;</p>
         <p>We had stepped into a room down on Grand street that had a &#8220;Caf&#233;&#8221; sign in the front.</p>
         <p>&#8220;These Eyetalians around here ain&#8217;t suffering from the high cost of things,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;It&#8217;s me and the American shopkeepers and families. We can&#8217;t go down on Mulberry street and pick up a fish for a dime and some rotten fruit for a few pennies; and that&#8217;s all that they live on down there. Eggs has gone up, and sugar. There is the &#8216;three for a dime&#8217; eggs on the stands, but who wants to eat them. I have to put them in my baking. I might as well tell you, seeing as you ain&#8217;t eating the cheese cake.&#8221;</p>
         <p><strong><em>Times Never So Bad.</em></strong></p>
         <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been keeping this store for the last twelve years, and times has never been so bad. I used to make some money at it, but now it&#8217;s just pinch and pinch. No use being cheerful about it. It&#8217;s these cheerful ones what are always hollering about how good times are - about how much work there is, and how high the pay is: it&#8217;s these that keep the prices up. The people don&#8217;t complain. They think. &#8216;What good will it do?&#8217; and don&#8217;t say a word.&#8221;</p>
         <p>A lean old woman, who walked as though ghostly fingers and baby hands were still clutching at her skirts, although her days of child-bearing were over, came in and wandered to one of the back tables.</p>
         <p>&#8220;See her,&#8221; the shopkeeper went on. &#8220;She&#8217;s American, same as me. Her old man died last winter. He was in Libby Prison &#8211; one of those old soldiers that never got a pension. Or maybe he got it and the lawyers got it away from him. There&#8217;s always them lawyers to butt into your business and take what yuh got.</p>
         <p><strong><em>Went Hungry Herself</em></strong></p>
         <p>&#8220;Well, her man got some kind of disease while he was in jail, and nothin&#8217; would ever cure it. The doctors only made it worse. It was in his throat and he couldn&#8217;t talk above a whisper. All he could eat was egg and milk, with a dash of brandy in it. But with things going up all the time, what could she do? She usta come down here and beg the stuff from me, and she&#8217;d go hungry herself to give it to him.</p>
         <p>&#8220;It was enough to make any one cry to see her come down to get just a little milk or a little sugar for him. And then she&#8217;d mix it herself &#8211; she wouldn&#8217;t let me &#8211; although half the time she was too weak to beat up the egg. And then she&#8217;d take a little sip on the way up stairs, now and then, because she was so hungry herself.</p>
         <p>&#8220;Now, if he&#8217;d only been one of these foreigners what can eat anything &#8211; but he was an American. There were some children, but most of them died: all but one, I think, and no one knows where he&#8217;s gone to. He says to me once: &#8216;When I&#8217;m old I don&#8217;t expect no one to take care of me.&#8217; So I guess he thought that it was the same way with them.</p>
         <p>&#8220;The children all dwindled away, and the old man dwindled away, and now she&#8217;s going. I&#8217;m going, too, just the same as them. And we&#8217;re Americans being robbed by our own.&#8221;</p>
