		States the objectives of the C.W. and defends it against the
accusations of other Catholics and secular thought. Writes on
such themes as marriage, sex, 10VQ' human condition, poverty,
economics and a variety of Church doctrines. All of these topics
are treated from an orthodox Catholic point of view. The book
is adapted from the diary she kept in 1948, when she spent the
first four months with Tamar (daughter) and the rest of the year
at Mott street and the retreat farm in Newburgh. She noted that
the book could be called a woman's book, since parts of it are
directed solely to women. As usual, much of the book dwells on
the day to day happenings in her life. (DDLW #5)

		Finally Tamar's son Eric is born. She comments on the child's baptism and the beginning of her own faith.

		Describes the hustle and bustle around the farm--planting, building, cooking. Ruminates about conversion, calling each person to a revolution beginning with themselves--to make a start toward a new way of living based on distributism.

		Calls picketing and demonstrating works of mercy--"rebuking the sinner, enlightening the ignorant, counseling the doubtful." Reflects on the challenge of over-mechanization and urges changing over to more "living criteria" for life.

		An essay and meditation about love in its many forms, human and divine. Quotes scripture, saints, secular writers, and especially Soloviev on love. Concludes that the Catholic Worker is " still trying to work out a theory of love, a study of the problem of love so that the revolution of love instead of that of hate may come about and we will have a new heaven and a new earth wherein justice dwelleth." Includes a poem whose theme is dying and rising. Deeply personal account of being with her dying mother.Includes prayers and meditations on death and dying. Prays to the Little Flower for her mother. Evidence of answered prayer came in a variety of roses from different sources.  (DDLW #485)
