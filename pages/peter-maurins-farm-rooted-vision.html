<H3>"Peter Maurin's farm-rooted vision gains ground among Catholic Worker"</H3>


<B>By<BR> Maria Benevento</B>

<p>"He asked nothing for himself, so he got nothing," Dorothy Day wrote in <i>Loaves and Fishes</i> of Peter Maurin, the man she considered the true founder of the Catholic Worker movement.

<p>Maurin did not cling to possessions, demand respect or seek personal recognition. He often takes a backseat to Day in stories of the movement they co-founded, and the aspect of the Catholic Worker that he's most associated with — farming communes or "agronomic universities" — was for decades considered one of the movement's biggest failures.

<p>However, in his very poverty and meekness, Maurin found his vocation: as a disciple of Christ on a mission to transform the modern world — in his own words — "from a society of go-getters to a society of go-givers."
