1. Politicians used to say:
     "We make prosperity
     through our wise policies."

2.  Business men used to say:
     "We make prosperity
     through our private enterprise."

3.  The workers did not have anything to say
     about the matter;

4.  They were either put to work
     or thrown out of employment

5.  And when unemployment came
     the workers
     had no recourse
     against the professed makers
     of prosperity,
     politicians and business men.

      in the art of following the wind
      of  public opinion.
2. He who follows the wind
      of public opinion
      does not follow
      his own judgement.
3. And he who does not follow 
      his own judgement
      cannot lead people
      out of the beaten path.
4. He is like the tail of a dog
      that tries to lead the head.
5. When people stand behind their president
      and their president
      stands behind them
      they and their president
      go around in a circle
      getting nowhere.

1. Business men say
     that because everybody is selfish
     business must necessarily
     be based on selfishness.

2. But when business
     is based on selfishness
     everbody is busy
     becoming more selfish.

3. And when everybody is busy
     becoming more selfish,
     you have classes and clashes.

4. Business men create problems;
     they do not solve them.

1. Out business managers
     don't know how to manage
     the things they try to manage,
     because they don't understand
     the things they try to manage.

2. So they turn to college professors
     in the hope of understanding
     the things they try to manage.

3. But college professors
     do not profess anything,
     they only teach subjects.

4. As teachers of subjects,
     college professors
     may enable people
     to master subjects,
     but mastering subjects
     has never enabled anyone
     to master situations.

1. Pope Pius IX and Cardinal Newman
     consider liberalism,
     whether it be
     religious, philosophical, or economic,
     the greatest error of the nineteenth century.

2. Modern liberalism
     is the logical sequence
     of the so-called age of Enlightenment-
     the age of Voltaire, Rousseau, Thomas Paine-
     sometimes called the Age of Reason
     in opposition to the Age of Faith.

3. By sponsoring nationalism and capitalism
     modern liberals
     have given up the search for truth
     and have become paid propagandists.

4. Modern liberals have ceased to appeal to reason,
     and have chosen to appeal to prejudice.

5. So the Age of Reason
     has become the age of Treason,
     as Julien Benda points out
     in his book entitled:
     "The treason of the Intellectuals".

1. Modern Society

2. But the Jews
     did not believe in it.

3. The Greeks
     did not believe in it.

4. The Romans
     did not believe in it.

5. The Mediaevals
     did not believe in it.

6. The Puritians
     did not believe in it.

7. Modern society
     has separated Church and State
     but it did not separate the State
     from business.

8. The State is no longer
     a Church's State.

9. The State is now
     a Business Men's State.

1. Ethical teachers seem to wish
     every worker to be a stockholder
     and every stockhoulder to be a worker.

2. As a stockholder
     the worker wants bigger dividends.

3. As a worker
     he wants bigger wages.

4. And the stock promoters
     stock him with stocks
     till he gets stuck.

5. And labor organizers
     promise him better conditions
     and exact bigger dues.

6. And the worker
     finds himself exploited
     both by stock promoters
     and labor organizers.

1. "What ails modern society
     is separation
     of the spiritual
     from the material",
     says Glenn Frank.

2. "Secularism is a pest",
     says Pius XI.

3. When religion
     has nothing to do
     with education,
     education,
     education is only
     information;
     plenty of facts,
     but no understanding.

4. When religion
     has nothing to do
     with politics,
     politics is only
     factionalism:
     "Let's turn the rascals out
     so our good friends
     can get in."

5. When religion 
     has nothing to do
     with business,
     business is only 
     commercialism:
     "Let's get what we can
     while the getting is good."

<P><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="3"><pre>
1. The modern man looks for thought
     so that he can have light,
     and he is unable to find it
     in our modern schools.

2. According to Professor Meiklejohn,
     "Students go school
     not to be directed
     but to become business men."

3. According to Glenn Frank,
     President of the University of Wisconsin,
     "Schools reflect the environment,
     they do not create it."

4. Which explains why
     shortly after their graduation,
     school graduates could be heard
     shouting with Rotarians:
     "Service for profits",
     "Time is money",
     "Keep Smiling",
     "Business is business",
     "How are you making out?"
     "The law of supply and demand",
     "Competition is the life of trade",
     "Your dollar is your best friend".

1. Chesterton says:
    &quot;The Christian ideal
    has not been tried
    and found wanting.
2. It has been found difficult
    and left untried.&quot;
3. Christianity has not been tried
    because people thought
    it was impractical.
4. And men have tried everything
    except Christianity.
5. And everything
    that men have tried
    has failed.

1. People who are in need 
    and are not afraid to beg 
    give to people not in need 
    the occasion to do good 
    for goodness'sake.
2. Modern society calls the beggar 
    bum and panhandler 
    and gives him the bum's rush. 
    But the Greeks used to say 
    that people in need
    are the ambassadors of the gods.
3. Although you may be called 
    bums and panhandlers 
    you are in fact
    the Ambassadors of God.
4. As God's Ambassadors 
    you should be given food, 
    clothing and shelter 
    by those who are able to give it.
5. Mahometan teachers tell us 
    that God commands hospitality, 
    and hospitality is still practiced 
    in Mahometan countries.
6. But the duty of hospitality 
    is neither taught nor practiced 
    in Christian countries.

1. Henry Adams, who had in his ancestry
     two Presidents of the United States,
     says in his autobiography
     that one cannot get an education
     in modern America.

2. And the reason he gives is,
     that there is
     no unity of thought
     in modern America.

3. So he went to England
     and found that modern England
     is too much like America.

4. So he went to France
     and found that modern France
     is too much like England and America.

5. But in France, Henry Adams found
     that one could get an education

6. And he wrote a book concerning

     of Christianity
     the Hospices
     or Houses of Hospitality
     was a shelter
     for the sick, the poor,
     the orphan, the old, the traveller,
     and the needy of every kind.

2. Originally the Hospices
     of Houses of Hospitality
     were under the supervision
     of the Bishops
     who designated priests
     to administer
     the spiritual
     and temporal affairs
     of these charitable institutions.

1. Christianity has nothing to do
     with either modern Capitalism
     or modern Communism,
     for Christianity
     has a Capitalism of its own,
     and a Communism of its own.

2. Modern Capitalism
     is based on property
     without responsibility,
     while Christian Capitalism
     is based on property
     with responsibility.

3. Modern Communism
     is based on poverty through force,
     while Christian Communism
     is based on poverty through choice.

4. For a Christian,
     voluntary poverty is the ideal
     as exemplified by Saint Francis of Assisi,
     while privte property
     is not an absolute right,
     but a trust,
     which must be administered
     for the benefit of God's children.

<i>Fr. Henry Carr, Superior of the Basilians, says:</i>
1. Socialists and Communists
     battle against
     the unequal conditions
     of the poor.

2. Presumably they would be satisfied
     if all were on a level.
 
3. Do you not see
     that this does not touch
     the question that is vital,
     namely, whether or not the people,
     no matter how much
     or how little they possess,
     regard it and use it
     in the way they should?

4. The right way
     is to regard it
     as something entrusted to us
     to use for the benefit
     of ourselves and others.

5. The wrong way
     is to look on it as something we own
     and can use as we desire
     without any duty to others.

6. Good or bad conditions
     will follow
     good or bad use
     of property.

4. Saint Francis desired

5. Saint Francis desired
