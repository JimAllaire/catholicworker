		<P>Aristode Pierre Maurin, later known as Peter Maurin, was co-founder
		with Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and is chiefly responsible
		for the movement's visionary qualities. </P>

		<P>He was born into a peasant family in Oultet, a village in the Languedoc
		region of southern France, on May 9, 1877. At sixteen he entered the Christian
		Brothers, a teaching order which stressed simplicity of life, piety, and
		service to the poor. In 1898-99, his community life was interrupted by
		obligatory military service, in the course of which Maurin perceived a
		tension between religious and political duties. In 1902, when the French
		government closed many religious schools, Maurin left the order and became
		active in Le Sillon, a Catholic lay movement which advocated Christian
		democracy and supported cooperatives and unions. In 1908, disenchanted
		with the movement's increasingly political character, Maurin resigned from
		Le Sellon. </P>

		<P>In 1909, he emigrated to Canada, where there was no military conscription.
		For two years he homesteaded in Saskatchewan. After the effort failed,
		he took whatever work he could find, first in Canada, then in the United
		States: digging ditches, quarrying stone, harvesting wheat, cutting lumber,
		and laying track. He worked in brickyards, steel mills and coal mines.
		At times he traded French lessons for his necessities. He was jailed for
		vagrancy and for riding the rails. He never married. In 1932, he was handyman
		at a Catholic boys' camp in upstate New York, receiving meals, use of the
		chaplain's library, and living space in the barn. </P>

		<P>Through his years of reflection and hard labor, Maurin came to embrace
		poverty as a gift from God. His unencumbered life offered time for study
		and prayer, out of which a vision had taken form of a social order instilled
		with basic values of the Gospel &quot;in which it would be easier for men
		to be good.&quot; </P>

		<P>As often as his work allowed, he made his way to New York City, staying
		in Bowery flop houses. His days were spent either at the Public Library
		or expounding his ideas to anyone who showed interest. After all, he reasoned,
		&quot;the way to reach the man on the street is meet the man on the street.&quot;
		He was a born teacher, lively, insightful and good humored, and found willing
		listeners, among them George Shuster, editor of <I>Commonweal</I> magazine, who
		gave him the address of Dorothy Day, a Catholic convert supporting herself
		as a freelance journalist. Maurin introduced himself to her in December
		1932. </P>

		<P>To many Maurin would have seemed just one more street-corner prophet.
		Day quickly came to regard him as an answer to her prayers, someone who
		could help her discover what she was supposed to do. </P>

		<P>Maurin saw Dorothy Day as a new St. Catherine of Siena, the medieval
		reformer and peace negotiator. Maurin believed Day could &quot;move mountains,
		and have influence on governments, temporal and spiritual.&quot; But first
		she needed a truly Catholic education. Maurin wanted her to look at history
		in a new way which centered not on the rise and fall of nations but on
		the lives of the saints. She had to understand that sanctity was what really
		mattered and that any program of social change must emphasize sanctity
		and community. </P>

		<P>Maurin proposed that Day start a newspaper to publicize Catholic social
		teaching and promote steps to bring about the peaceful transformation of
		society. Day responded positively, though unsure how she would ever find
		the money for such a venture. &quot;In the history of the saints,&quot;
		Maurin assured her, &quot;capital is raised by prayer. God sends you what
		you need when you need it. You will be able to pay the printer. Just read
		the lives of the saints.&quot; </P>

		<P>The name Maurin proposed for the paper was The Catholic Radical. The
		radical -- from the Latin word radix meaning root -- is someone who doesn't
		settle for cosmetic solutions, he said, but goes to the root of personal
		and social problems. Day felt that the name should refer to the class of
		the readers she hoped the paper would have and so named it <I><A HREF="cwtoc.htm">The
		Catholic Worker</A></I>. &quot;Man proposes and woman disposes,&quot; Maurin
		responded meekly. </P>

		<P>However when the first issue of was ready for distribution May 1, 1933,
		Maurin was disappointed and asked that his name not be included among the
		list of editors. He found the paper short on ideas, principles and a strategy
		for a new social order. Apart from his own blank verse <A HREF="maurin.htm">&quot;Essay
		Essays&quot;</A> and a few quotations from the Bible and papal encyclicals,
		the rest of the paper struck him as just one more journal of radical protest.
		</P>

		<P>A radical even among radicals, Maurin thought protest would do little
		to bring about real change. &quot;Strikes don't strike me,&quot; he said,
		arguing that the old order would die from neglect, not censure. What was
		needed first of all was a vision of a future society, and with this a program
		of constructive steps with which to begin realizing bits of the vision
		in one's own life. The Catholic Worker, Maurin said, should not just one
		more group of complainers. It should work for what he called &quot;the
		green revolution.&quot; </P>

		<P>He saw no point in struggling for better hours or more pay in places
		where the work was dehumanizing. It was time, he said, &quot;to fire the
		bosses.&quot; But where, he was asked, could they go? How would they live?
		&quot;There is no unemployment on the land,&quot; Maurin replied. The Catholic
		Worker should stand for a decentralized society stressing cooperation rather
		than duress, with artisans and craftsmen in worker-owned small factories,
		and agricultural communities. Coming together in agricultural communities,
		worker and scholar could both sweat, think and pray together and in the
		process develop &quot;a worker-- scholar synthesis.&quot; </P>

		<P>Maurin was often accused of being a utopian romantic longing to return
		to travel backward rather than forward in time. But Day gradually became
		more open to his critique of assembly-line civilization and came to share
		his view that improved, unionized industrialism wasn't enough, that community
		was better than mass society. </P>

		<P>In his <I>Catholic Worker</I> essays, Maurin repeatedly advocated renewal of
		the ancient Christian practice of hospitality: </P>

		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P><I>People who are in need and are not afraid to beg give to people not
		in need the occasion to do good for goodness' sake. Modern society calls
		the beggar bum and panhandler and gives him the bum's rush. But the Greeks
		used to say that people in need are ambassadors of the gods. Although you
		may be called bums and panhandlers you are in fact the ambassadors of God.
		As God's ambassadors you should be given food, clothing and shelter by
		those who are able to give it. </I></P>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>

		<P>Every home, Maurin said, should have its &quot;Christ Room&quot; and
		every parish a house of hospitality ready to receive the &quot;ambassadors
		of God.&quot; Within a year of its founding, the Catholic Worker movement
		was known as much for its houses of hospitality as for its newspaper. </P>

		<P>A strong believer in education through dialogue, Maurin advocated &quot;round
		table discussions for the clarification of thought.&quot; Friday night
		meetings quickly became a tradition of the Catholic Worker community. </P>

		<P>Catholic Workers also took up his call to start farming communes, which
		Maurin preferred to call &quot;agronomic universities.&quot; In 1938 Maurin
		moved to Mary Farm, a ten-acre property the Catholic Worker community bought
		in Easton, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately there were always a surplus of people
		who preferred a discussion of theology or politics to work on the fields
		or the repair of a hinge. &quot;It seemed,&quot; Day noted, &quot;that
		the more people there were around, the less got done.&quot; Small matters
		took on divisive significance. Maurin alone seemed to look after basic
		chores. In 1944 part of the farm was sold, another part given away to a
		cantankerous group that regarded themselves as &quot;the true Catholic
		Workers.&quot; </P>

		<P>Other &quot;farms&quot; were set up, but were more rural houses of hospitality
		than agricultural communities. </P>

		<P>From the founding of the Catholic Worker movement in 1933 until 1944,
		Peter often travelled, speaking in church halls and on street corners to
		anyone who cared to listen. In 1944, following what appeared to be a minor
		stroke, Maurin slowly began losing his memory. His last five years were
		lived quietly and humbly at the Catholic Worker's Maryfarm Retreat Center
		near Newburgh. His death in 1949 was reported by <I>The New York Times</I> and
		the Vatican newspaper, <I>L'Osservatore Romano</I>. <I>Time</I> magazine noted that Maurin
		was buried in a &quot;castoff suit and consigned to a donated grave,&quot;
		appropriate arrangements for a man who &quot;had slept in no bed of his
		own and worn no suit that someone had not given away.&quot; </P>

		<P>After his death, a Catholic Worker farm located on Staten Island was
		named in his honor. Today the Peter Maurin Farm continues in Marlborough,
		New York. </P>
